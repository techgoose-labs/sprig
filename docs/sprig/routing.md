# Routing

Routes map URL paths to pages. The app is assembled in `main.ts` from three
pieces: a route table (`defineRoutes`), an SSR renderer (`createRenderer`), and
`bootstrap`.

## Defining routes

```ts
// src/main.ts
import {
  bootstrap,
  defineRoutes,
  type Route,
  type SprigApp,
} from "@techgoose-labs/sprig";
import { dirname, fromFileUrl } from "@std/path";
import {
  createRenderer,
  type SsrRenderer,
} from "../../framework/.sprig/compiler/mod.ts";
import { resolve as workbenchResolve } from "./pages/workbench/resolve.ts";
import { resolve as galleryResolve } from "./pages/gallery/resolve.ts";

export const routes: Route[] = defineRoutes([
  { path: "", load: "./pages/workbench" }, // index
  { path: "components", load: "./pages/gallery" },
  { path: "pages", load: "./pages/gallery" },
  { path: "issues/:id", load: "./pages/issue" }, // :id → ctx.params.id (URL-decoded)
]);

export const renderer: SsrRenderer = await createRenderer(
  dirname(fromFileUrl(import.meta.url)), // the src dir to scan
  "/ui", // base path
  { dev: !!Deno.env.get("SPRIG_DEV") },
);

export const app: SprigApp = bootstrap({
  routes,
  base: "/ui",
  modules: {
    "./pages/workbench": { resolve: workbenchResolve },
    "./pages/gallery": { resolve: galleryResolve },
  },
  render: (load, inputs) => renderer.renderDocument(load, inputs),
});
```

- `path` is matched segment-by-segment. A `:param` segment captures into
  `ctx.params` (and is **URL-decoded** — `%20` → space). Routes may nest via
  `children` for a primary child chain.
- `load` is the page folder key; it indexes both `modules` (its `resolve`) and
  the renderer (its `template.html`, resolved by folder basename).
- `base` mounts the whole app under a prefix (`/ui`).
  `createRenderer(srcDir, base, { dev })` scans `srcDir` for folder-components
  and builds the registry once at boot.

## Params in a resolver

```ts
export const resolve: Resolve = async (ctx) => {
  const issue = await inject(IssueService).issue(ctx.params.id); // already decoded
  return { issue };
};
```

## Guards

A guard is a function that returns **the route the navigation should go to**, as
an array of path segments. Returning the route it was about to hit anyway
(`ctx.path`) lets the navigation proceed; returning any other route answers the
request with a **302 redirect** there instead (bare path, prefixed with `base`).
Guards attach to routes; a parent's guards protect its whole subtree.

```ts
import { defineRoutes, type Guard, inject } from "@techgoose-labs/sprig";
import { Session } from "./services/session.ts";

const requireAuth: Guard = (ctx) => {
  const session = inject(Session); // DI — the same route injector resolve() gets
  if (!session.user) return ["login"]; // → 302 /login
  return ctx.path; // same route → proceed
};

export const routes = defineRoutes([
  { path: "login", load: "./pages/login" },
  {
    path: "admin",
    load: "./pages/admin",
    guards: [requireAuth], // protects /admin AND /admin/users
    children: [{ path: "users", load: "./pages/users" }],
  },
]);
```

- **Contract:** `(ctx: GuardCtx) => string[] | Promise<string[]>` with
  `ctx = { path, params,
  url, headers }`. `ctx.path` is the target's post-base
  segments exactly as they appear in the URL (undecoded, so returning it
  round-trips); `ctx.params` are the decoded `:param` captures; `ctx.headers`
  are the incoming request's headers — page navigations carry the browser's
  cookies there, which is what a server-side login guard checks (a marker
  cookie; an `Authorization` header never accompanies a document navigation).
- **Normalization:** returned elements may carry `/` separators and empty
  segments are dropped — `["admin","users"]` ≡ `["admin/users"]`; `[]` means the
  root route.
- **Order:** the matched chain's guards run **parent-first** (a route's own
  guards last), each awaited; the first guard whose route differs from the
  target wins. All-pass → the page renders.
- **Before `resolve`:** guards run first, so a denied page does no data work.
- **DI:** call `inject()` synchronously (before any `await`), exactly like in
  `resolve` — guards run on the request's route injector, so a service a guard
  instantiates is the SAME instance the page's `resolve` later injects.
- **Failure:** a throwing guard is a controlled **500** (fails closed).
- **Client:** a soft-nav that hits a guard redirect falls back to a full
  navigation (redirected responses are deliberately not soft-swapped), so the
  browser lands on the redirect target normally — no client-side guard wiring
  needed.
- **Complete example:** [`fixtures/guarded-app`](../../fixtures/guarded-app/) —
  a login flow, subtree inheritance, an async admin check, and guard-only
  "action" routes.

## The shell `<router-outlet>`

The matched page renders into the shell's `<router-outlet>`, which SSR emits as
a persistent **`<sprig-outlet>`** element. This is the soft-nav swap boundary —
keep it in the shell.

```html
<!-- shell/template.html -->
<div class="app-root">
  <router-outlet></router-outlet>
</div>
```

## What `bootstrap().fetch` enforces

- **Off-base 404:** any path not under `base` (including a bare `/` when a base
  is set) returns 404 — the index is only reachable on-base.
- **No route match → 404.**
- **Method gating:** SSR pages are read-only resources. `OPTIONS` → 204
  (`Allow: GET, HEAD,
  OPTIONS`); anything other than `GET`/`HEAD` → 405.
- **Guards:** the matched chain's guards run next (parent-first, before
  `resolve`); the first guard returning a route other than the target → **302**
  to it (on-base). A throwing guard → 500.
- **Resolver-set status:** honored on the response line (e.g.
  `setResponseStatus(…, 404)` — see [data-and-di.md](./data-and-di.md)).
- **Hardening + cache headers** on every HTML response:
  `content-type: text/html`, `cache-control: no-store`,
  `x-content-type-options: nosniff`, `x-frame-options: DENY`,
  `referrer-policy: no-referrer`.
- A resolver/render failure becomes a controlled **500** (no internal text
  leaked).

## Soft navigation (client)

When the browser supports the **Navigation API**, same-origin links under `base`
are soft-navigated: sprig fetches the destination, parses it, and swaps **only
the `<sprig-outlet>`** innerHTML inside a view transition (when available).
Islands **outside** the outlet stay mounted (state preserved); islands inside
are torn down and re-armed (their chunks lazy-load again on trigger).

It deliberately falls back to a full browser navigation for: non-interceptable
events, hash-only changes, downloads, form posts, cross-origin or off-base
targets, reloads, same-path (query/hash-only) navigations, and any non-2xx /
redirected / non-HTML response. Scroll is restored on back/forward, scrolls to a
`#fragment` target when present, else jumps to top. Browsers without the
Navigation API just do normal navigations.
