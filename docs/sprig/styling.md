# Styling & view encapsulation

Each component's `styles.css` is **view-encapsulated** — its rules can only land
on that component's own elements. sprig uses Angular's "Emulated" model (no
Shadow DOM, so it's SSR-friendly).

## How it works

Every component gets a stable **scope id** derived from its **unique folder
path** (FNV-1a hash of the path relative to `src/`, e.g. `s1a2b3c4d`). Two
mechanisms share that id:

1. **At SSR**, every native element the component's template emits carries the
   scope id as a bare marker attribute (`<div s1a2b3c4d class="card">…`).
2. **At build**, each rule in the component's `styles.css` is rewritten so its
   **rightmost (key) compound** also requires that marker: `.card h3 { }` →
   `.card h3[s1a2b3c4d] { }`.

Result: a rule from component A can never match an element of component B (which
carries B's marker). Rightmost-only scoping is sufficient because the _styled_
element always carries the marker.

Because the id comes from the **path** (not the basename),
`shared-components/issue-card/` and `pages/board/components/issue-card/` get
**different** ids — their styles never collide. See
[folder-components.md](./folder-components.md).

```css
/* shared-components/counter/styles.css — scoped to <counter>'s elements only */
.counter {
  display: flex;
  gap: .5rem;
}
.counter button {
  padding: .25rem .75rem;
}
```

## Escaping encapsulation: `:global`

Use `:global(...)` for document-level rules (the key compound is left unscoped):

```css
:global(body) {
  margin: 0;
}
:global(:root) {
  --accent: #c2410c;
}
```

Typically the **shell**'s `styles.css` holds your `:global(body)` /
`:global(:root)` rules.

`@keyframes`, `@font-face`, `@page`, `@property`, `@charset`, `@import`,
`@namespace`, and `@counter-style` bodies are left **unscoped** (their content
isn't a list of style rules). Rule-bearing at-rules (`@media`, `@supports`,
`@container`, `@layer`, `@starting-style`, …) are recursed into, so their inner
rules get the marker too. `:host` / `:host(x)` / `:host-context(x)` map to the
scope marker as you'd expect.

## The scope id is consistent across SSR / CSS / hydrate

The same path-derived id is stamped by the SSR renderer, baked into the scoped
`app.css`, and **carried in each island's chunk** so the client re-render
re-emits the _same_ marker. That's why scoped styles survive hydration and a
reactive re-render — the morphed DOM keeps its markers.

## Tailwind

`sprig build` runs the Tailwind v4 CLI over your component CSS and templates:

- `@apply` works inside component `styles.css`.
- Utility classes used in `template.html` files are scanned and emitted
  (`@source` points at your `src/**/*.html`).
- Everything is concatenated, scoped, Tailwind-expanded, minified → one
  `static/app.css`, linked from every SSR document with the `?v=` cache-buster.

```css
.cta {
  @apply inline-flex items-center rounded-md px-3 py-1.5 font-medium;
}
```

(Not `.btn` — that name belongs to daisyUI, see the next section.)

## daisyUI is in the build — reserved class names

The build also loads **daisyUI 5** as a Tailwind plugin
(`@plugin "daisyui" { themes: false }`, pinned by sprig, not by your app). Its
_themes_ are off — your `css-variables.json` tokens are the brand — but its
**components are on**: write `<button class="btn btn-primary">` or
`<div class="card">` in any template and daisyUI's button/card rules are emitted
into `app.css`. That is the point. The trap is the flip side:

**daisyUI's rules are document-global and are emitted on demand.** Tailwind
scans your templates for class tokens; the moment it sees one that names a
daisyUI component (`stat`, `badge`, `list`, `status`…) it emits that component's
rules, targeting the **bare class**, unscoped, in a `daisyui.*` layer. View
encapsulation protects your rules from _other components' rules_; it does
nothing against daisyUI, because daisyUI's rule matches the bare class on the
same element.

So this (from a real island — an 8px status dot):

```css
/* islands/coms-island/styles.css */
.coms-island .stat {
  width: 8px;
  height: 8px;
  border-radius: 9999px;
}
```

renders as a **daisyUI stat block**: your scoped rule is unlayered, so it wins
on the three properties it sets — and daisyUI's
`.stat { display: inline-grid; padding-inline: 1.5rem;
padding-block: 1rem; grid-template-columns: … }`
supplies everything it doesn't. Under Preflight's `box-sizing: border-box` the
8px box can't shrink below its own padding, so the "dot" is a 48×32px
inline-grid cell. (Verified against `daisyui@5.7.28`: only the `.stat` rules
were emitted, nothing for `btn`/`card`, because only `stat` appeared in the
template.)

"Fully reset it" is the wrong fix — the property set is daisyUI's, and it
changes between minor versions. **Rename your element. `sprig build` /
`sprig dev` warn when a component's `styles.css` targets any class the bundled
daisyUI defines** (bare names and their parts and modifiers — the exact set is
read from the installed package, so it always matches the version the build just
compiled with):

```
sprig: islands/coms-island/styles.css styles .stat, .stat-value — daisyUI (bundled by the build)
styles the same class name(s) globally, so these rules only override the properties they set on
top of daisyUI's. Unless you mean the daisyUI component, rename with your own prefix
(e.g. .co-stat). See docs/sprig/styling.md → "Reserved class names".
```

The warning is exact: `.statistic`, `.dock-tab` or `.list-item` don't fire,
because daisyUI defines no such class _today_. Which is why the convention below
reserves the whole prefix.

### The reserved list (`daisyui@5.7.28`)

Every bare name below is a daisyUI component or utility with its own global
rule. Each one also owns its **`<name>-*` namespace** — parts and modifiers like
`stat-title`, `stat-value`, `btn-sm`, `card-body`, `menu-title`, `list-row`,
`tab-content`, `chat-bubble`, `badge-primary` (653 class names in all) — and
daisyUI adds to those namespaces in minor releases, so treat the whole prefix as
taken:

`alert` `aura` `avatar` `badge` `breadcrumbs` `btn` `cally` `card` `carousel`
`chat` `checkbox` `collapse` `countdown` `diff` `divider` `dock` `drawer`
`dropdown` `fab` `fieldset` `filter` `footer` `glass` `hero` `indicator` `input`
`join` `kbd` `label` `link` `list` `loading` `mask` `megamenu` `menu` `modal`
`navbar` `otp` `progress` `radio` `range` `rating` `select` `skeleton` `stack`
`stat` `stats` `status` `step` `steps` `swap` `tab` `table` `tabs` `textarea`
`timeline` `toast` `toggle` `tooltip` `validator` `vc`

The generic ones bite hardest: `status`, `list`, `label`, `link`, `filter`,
`stack`, `table`, `toggle`, `indicator`, `loading`, `footer`, `hero`, `mask`,
`diff`, `collapse`, `step`.

Footnotes (not warned on, but daisyUI's): `.disabled` is a qualifier under
`.menu` (`li.disabled`), `.prose` gets `--tw-prose-*` variables, and `.step`
only matches inside `.steps`. Responsive twins (`sm:toast`, `lg:join`) follow
their root.

This list mirrors `DAISYUI_RESERVED_CLASSES` in
`framework/.sprig/compiler/build.ts` — the build's fallback when it can't read
the installed package, and a test keeps the two in sync. To regenerate it after
a daisyUI bump, run `installedDaisyuiClasses("~/.cache/sprig-tailwind")` from
that file (it reads the package's `components/*.css` + `utilities/*.css`,
selectors only) and keep the names without a hyphen.

### The convention: prefix your own classes

Pick a short prefix per app or per component and use it for **every class you
style yourself** — a name that is yours can never be daisyUI's tomorrow either:

```css
/* islands/coms-island/styles.css — `cm-` is this app's prefix */
.cm-root {
  display: flex;
  gap: .5rem;
}
.cm-dot {
  width: 8px;
  height: 8px;
  border-radius: 9999px;
} /* was .stat */
.cm-dot--online {
  background: var(--color-success);
}
```

sprig's own isolate workbench does exactly this after hitting the same collision
on `dock`, `badge`, `kbd` and `toast`: its chrome is `wb-dock`, `wb-badge`,
`wb-kbd`, `wb-toast`.

Two-letter app prefixes (`cm-`, `wb-`) or the component's name (`coms-dot`) both
work; BEM modifiers (`--sm`) on a prefixed block are fine. The only rule:
**don't start a class you style with a reserved name or `<reserved>-`.**
Unprefixed names that aren't reserved (`.counter`, `.hdot`) are safe today but
one daisyUI release away from not being.

Conversely, when you _want_ the daisyUI component, use its own names and
modifiers as documented (`btn btn-sm`, `stat` + `stat-title`/`stat-value`) and
let the theme tokens style it — `status` is daisyUI's own 0.5rem status dot
(`status status-success`), which is what the island above ended up wanting.
