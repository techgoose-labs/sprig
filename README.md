# sprig

A folder-component web framework for Deno: **Angular-flavoured templates**
compiled to HTML, **server-rendered** with **selective island hydration**,
**view-encapsulated** CSS, and dependency injection — no Vite, a
state-preserving HMR dev loop, and a single `deno serve` to production (Deno
Deploy ready).

```bash
deno run -A framework/cli.ts init my-app   # scaffold
cd my-app && deno task dev                  # → http://localhost:8000/ui  (HMR)
```

## Why

- **Folder = component.** A folder with a `template.html` is a component; add a
  `logic.ts` and it becomes an interactive **island**. No imports to wire, no
  registration.
- **Server-first.** Pages render to HTML on the server (`resolve.ts` loads data
  via DI); only islands ship JS, code-split one chunk per island, hydrated on
  their trigger.
- **Encapsulated.** Each component's `styles.css` is scoped to its own markup —
  no leakage.
- **One origin.** `Bedrock({ ui, backend, auth })` composes a
  [keep](packages/keep/mod.ts) backend (an in-process `Backend` for SSR + a
  token-gated `/api/*` channel) with the UI under one `{ fetch }` handler.

## The CLI

```
sprig init  [dir]              scaffold a minimal, runnable sprig app
sprig dev   [appDir] [entry]   state-preserving HMR dev server (no Vite)
sprig build [appDir]           code-split islands + scope CSS + Tailwind → static/
sprig serve [entry]            boot a serve.ts's default { fetch } handler
```

Run it as `deno run -A framework/cli.ts <cmd>` (or `deno task sprig <cmd>` in
this repo).

> The `cli/`, `server/`, and `app/` directories are the **isolate** project — a
> sprig component testing workbench (`app/` is its UI). It discovers a sprig
> project's folder-components, generates an isolated preview per case, and
> serves them under one origin (no Vite, no Fresh):
> `deno run -A cli/main.ts dev -r fixtures/sprig-app`. See
> [`docs/guide.md`](docs/guide.md) for the full framework guide.
>
> The `claude/` directory holds the Claude Code assets sprig deploys on
> `sprig install` / `sprig update`: `claude/skills/` → `~/.claude/skills` (one
> folder per skill) and `claude/agents/` → `~/.claude/agents` (one `.md` file
> per subagent). See [`claude/README.md`](claude/README.md).

## Documentation

- **[docs/guide.md](docs/guide.md)** — the full guide: project layout,
  folder-components, template syntax, islands & hydration, dependency injection,
  the CLI, and hosting.

## Test

```bash
deno test -A framework/.sprig/compiler/compiler.test.ts   # framework unit tests
deno test -A app/spine.test.ts                            # the example app's SSR/API spine
```

## Releasing

Before bumping `version` in `deno.json` and publishing:

1. **Agent-facing docs move WITH the API.** If the release changes any public
   runtime/ compiler surface (`framework/.sprig/core.ts` exported types,
   template semantics, the isolate CLI's flags or report shape), the same commit
   must update the matching `claude/skills/*/references/*.md` and agent defs. A
   release that ships an API the refs don't describe sends every build fleet
   reverse-engineering the Deno cache (measured: 112 tool calls re-deriving
   `ResolveCtx` after 0.20.29 shipped it undocumented).
2. Run the framework + runner tests (above) and `deno check cli/main.ts`.
3. Spot-check `claude/skills/sprig:build/references/` examples still typecheck
   against the new surface.
