# claude/ — Claude Code assets shipped by sprig

Everything under this folder is deployed into the user's **`~/.claude`** scope
by `sprig install` / `sprig update` (and `deno task install:dev` from a
checkout). It rides inside the runtime bundle (see
`.github/workflows/release.yml`) and is installed by
`framework/.sprig/skills.ts`.

Two siblings, each installed with the same base-level (whole-entry) replace
keyed by name — an entry that already exists is replaced outright; unrelated
entries are left untouched; new ones are created. A destination holding a `.git`
checkout is never clobbered (so a dev symlink survives).

| source           | installs to                              | unit                                        |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| `claude/skills/` | `${CLAUDE_SKILLS_DIR:-~/.claude/skills}` | one **folder** per skill (needs `SKILL.md`) |
| `claude/agents/` | `${CLAUDE_AGENTS_DIR:-~/.claude/agents}` | one **`.md` file** per subagent             |

Notes:

- **Skills** are folders. Each top-level dir under `claude/skills/` must contain
  a `SKILL.md` (the `interfaces/` shared-contracts sibling is the one exception
  — it is carried wholesale so each skill resolves
  `../interfaces/<artifact>.md`).
- **Agents** are flat markdown files. Claude Code only discovers
  `~/.claude/agents/*.md` (one subagent per file, frontmatter
  `name`/`description`/`tools`), so drop agent definitions directly in
  `claude/agents/` as `<name>.md`.
- Dotfiles (e.g. `.gitkeep`) are skipped by the installer; this README lives one
  level up so it is never copied into either destination.
