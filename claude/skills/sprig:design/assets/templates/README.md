# {{Brand}} Design System

> **Note on naming:** the daisyUI theme is named `brand`/`brand-dark` (generic)
> so the artifact stays a reusable template; the brand identity lives in the
> token _values_ and in this doc.

{{One-paragraph brand positioning: who it's for, the feeling.}}

Built to be **consumed by the `prototype` skill** with zero translation. Single
source of truth: **`theme.css`** (Tailwind 4 + daisyUI 5).

| `manifest.json` · `adherence.oxlintrc.json` | Token + card index; lint allow-list                                      | Derived       |
| `preview/`                                  | Specimens that `<link>` the canonical theme; `showcase.html` is the demo | Derived       |
| `assets/`                                   | Logos, illustrations (placeholders unless supplied)                      | Asset         |

> **Canonical vs derived:** edit `theme.css` only; regenerate everything marked
> _Derived_ from it.

## Brand voice

{{Pronoun/register, casing, pace, emoji policy, number/date locale — a few
bullets.}}

## Visual foundations (the 4 pillars)

1. **Typography** — {{Display}} (display) + {{Body}} (body); {{heading
   tracking}}.
2. **Motion** — {{easing + durations}}; nothing over 400ms.
3. **Depth & atmosphere** — daisyUI `--depth` + {{shadow signature}}; {{glass?
   no}}.
4. **Signature moment** — {{the brand wink: a celebratory state, a motif}}.

### Palette at a glance

{{anchor colors with hex + role; note which is the precious primary}}.

## Caveats

- Brand name/logo/illustrations are placeholders unless supplied.
- Fonts via {{Google Fonts / self-hosted}}.
- Icons: {{Lucide, stroke}} — flag if a different set is preferred.
