# design

A skill that **generates design-system artifacts** — a self-contained,
brand-themed folder written to `spec/ui/design-system/` (the shared UI-pipeline
home), which the `prototype` skill consumes with zero translation.

Each artifact's single source of truth is one `theme.css` (a daisyUI-5 brand
theme); everything else (`theme.cdn.css`, `manifest.json`,
`adherence.oxlintrc.json`, preview specimens) is derived from it. The build
process is **MCP-driven** — it pulls the canonical theme template and component
classes from the `daisyui-blueprint` MCP so the output matches the installed
daisyUI version — folds in theme-native ApexCharts, and ends by rendering a
showcase to verify.

- **Entry point:** [`SKILL.md`](SKILL.md) — the process.
- **`references/`** — structure (canonical vs derived), theme authoring,
  components & charts, consume & verify.
- **`assets/templates/`** — fill-in starter files for every artifact file.

Output location: **`spec/ui/design-system/`** (relative to the **git root** —
the dir containing `.git`, falling back to the project dir outside a git repo).
The folder is brand-generic (`brand` / `brand-dark`) so it can be lifted out and
reused as a standalone design-system skill.
