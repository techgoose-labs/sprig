  Create a reusable design-system artifact — a daisyUI-5 brand theme plus tokens,
  component/chart recipes, and consume guides — that the prototype skill can apply with
  zero translation. Use this whenever the user wants to build or generate a design system,
  brand theme, or design tokens: phrases like "create a design system", "make a
  brand/design system", "build a theme for our brand", "turn this palette/brand/logo/Figma
  into a design system", "design tokens our prototypes and sprig apps can share", or "a
  house style we can reuse". Produces a folder whose single source of truth is one
  theme.css, with derived files, docs, preview specimens, and its own SKILL.md so the
  output is itself an invokable skill. NOT for applying an already-built design system (use
  its consume recipe, or the prototype skill), restyling a single component, or building a
  one-off throwaway mock (that's the prototype skill).

# design — orchestrate a brand design-system artifact

> **Pipeline stage — design** (start). Produces the `design-system` contract
> (`../interfaces/design-system.md`), consumed by `prototype`. Full chain:
> design → prototype → breakdown → build → audit.

Generate a **design-system artifact**: a self-contained, brand-themed folder at
`spec/ui/design-system/` that the **`prototype`** skill consumes directly (it
pastes the flattened twin inline). The artifact is itself an invokable skill (it
ships a `SKILL.md`). The brand then rides downstream through the rest of the
pipeline, so **design only ever talks to `prototype`**.

**You are the orchestrator. You don't author, derive, or render yourself — you
delegate each pass to a named specialist** and chain them around the one rule
below.

## The one rule that matters most

**There is exactly one source of truth: `theme.css`.** `theme.cdn.css`,
`css-variables.json`, `manifest.json`, `adherence.oxlintrc.json`, and the values
in `preview/*.html` are all _derived_ from it. Never let the same token be
hand-maintained in two places — that drift (pink here, green there) is the exact
failure this format prevents. The canonical-vs-derived layout is
`references/structure.md`.

## The specialists you delegate to

| Agent                       | Pass                                                                                                                                                                                 | Owns / reads                                                                                                                      |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **`sprig-design-author`**   | author the canonical `theme.css` (daisyUI MCP) + font pairing (typography MCP) + non-color layer + `components.md`/charts                                                            | `references/theme-and-tokens.md`, `references/typography.md`, `references/components-and-charts.md`, `assets/templates/theme.css` |
| **`sprig-design-deriver`**  | derive the machine files (`theme.cdn.css`, `css-variables.json`, `manifest.json`, `adherence.oxlintrc.json`) + docs (`consume/prototype.md`, `README.md`, the artifact's `SKILL.md`) | `references/structure.md`, `assets/templates/`                                                                                    |
| **`sprig-design-verifier`** | serve + screenshot `showcase.html` light & dark; catch the collapsed-layout failure                                                                                                  | `references/consume-and-verify.md`                                                                                                |

Each specialist owns its own procedure (the MCP calls, the derivation, the
render loop) — **do not restate their steps here.**

## The flow

1. **Author.** Delegate to **`sprig-design-author`** with the brand brief (+ any
   Figma URL) and the output dir → it writes `theme.css` (light `brand` + dark
   `brand-dark`), picks the fonts, adds the non-color layer, and writes
   `components.md` + chart recipes. Take its note of the font pairing, the
   semantic mapping, and any brand lint-exception.
2. **Derive.** Delegate to **`sprig-design-deriver`** with the output dir (now
   holding `theme.css`) → it emits the derived machine files and the docs (incl.
   `showcase.html` and the artifact's own `SKILL.md`), byte-consistent with
   `theme.css`, documenting any flagged brand exception in
   `consume/prototype.md`.
3. **Verify.** Delegate to **`sprig-design-verifier`** → it serves
   `showcase.html` over HTTP and screenshots light + dark, returning a PASS/FAIL
   on the collapsed-layout check. On FAIL or an off-token result, loop back to
   the author (theme issue) or deriver (derivation issue), then re-verify.
   **Looking is the test** — don't declare done on markup alone.

## Orchestrator conduct

- **After spawning a specialist, END YOUR TURN** — task notifications re-invoke
  you; never `sleep`-poll between passes. Never search the filesystem yourself
  (skill references live at exact `~/.claude/skills/<skill>/references/` paths).
- **Brief completely — a specialist that searches was under-briefed.** Pass the
  artifact dir (`spec/ui/design-system/`) and the `theme.css` path down the
  chain — absolute, copied verbatim from the previous stage's return, never
  retyped, never "glob for it". A specialist reporting `blocked: missing path`
  means the brief was wrong: fix the brief and re-delegate.
- **Verify by receipt.** The deriver's byte-consistency confirmation and the
  verifier's screenshots + PASS/FAIL verdict ARE the state — don't re-read
  derived files or re-shoot the showcase to double-check what a specialist
  already returned; a FAIL loops back to the owning specialist (author for theme
  issues, deriver for derivation issues), never gets patched inline.

## Output location & naming

Write to **`spec/ui/design-system/`** (relative to the **git root**; create
`spec/ui/` if absent) — the shared UI-pipeline home. Use a **generic theme
name** (`brand`/`brand-dark`) inside `theme.css` so the artifact stays a
reusable template; refer to the brand by name only in prose. (Copy the folder
elsewhere for a standalone brand-named skill — but the pipeline home is this
fixed path.)

## Lint awareness (prototype's design-lint)

`prototype` ships a `design-lint` auditor. A brand may legitimately trip
`cream-palette`, `overused-font`, or `bounce-easing`. When a brand intentionally
uses one, the author flags it and the deriver documents it as a known exception
in `consume/prototype.md` — never ship it silently.

## Distribution

These artifacts install as skills: `npx skills add <folder>`, or drop the folder
into a project's `skills/`. The folded-in `daisyui-charts` companion installs
the same way.

## Reference map (owned by the specialists)

- `references/structure.md` — file layout; canonical vs derived →
  **`sprig-design-deriver`**.
- `references/theme-and-tokens.md` — authoring `theme.css` →
  **`sprig-design-author`**.
- `references/typography.md` — font pairing + type scale →
  **`sprig-design-author`**.
- `references/components-and-charts.md` — component + chart recipes →
  **`sprig-design-author`**.
- `references/consume-and-verify.md` — consume recipe + render/verify loop →
  **`sprig-design-verifier`**.
- `assets/templates/` — fill-in starter files (author: `theme.css`; deriver: the
  rest).
