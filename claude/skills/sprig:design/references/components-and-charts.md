# Components & charts

## Components — pull recipes from the MCP, never hand-write

For each component the artifact documents (button, card, badge, alert, input,
stat, table, modal, tabs, navbar, …), call `daisyUI-Snippets` with
`{ "components": { "<name>": true } }` and copy the class recipe. Write them
into `components.md` as small, brand-voiced snippets.

**Why the MCP is non-negotiable here:** daisyUI 5 removed v4 staples, and these
are exactly the classes a model "remembers" wrong:

- `input-bordered` → gone; `input` is bordered by default.
- `form-control` / `label-text` → gone; use `fieldset` / `legend` / `label`.
- Component color/size/style class families (`btn-{primary…}`, `btn-{xs…xl}`,
  `btn-{outline,soft,ghost,…}`) are enumerated by the MCP — copy them rather
  than guessing.

Rules for the recipes:

- **Semantic colors only** (`btn-primary`, `bg-base-100`, `text-base-content`)
  so they retheme with `data-theme`. Never raw `gray-*` or hex.
- The classes go in `prototype`'s plain HTML with Lucide via `<i data-lucide>`.

A `templates`/`layouts` pull is also available
(`{ "templates": { "dashboard": true } }`, `{ "layouts": { … } }`) — useful when
scaffolding the `showcase.html` dashboard.

## Charts — theme-native, folded from `daisyui-charts`

The `daisyui-charts` package (ApexCharts recipes for area/column/line/pie/mixed)
is the model for a data-viz layer. The key property: **its charts read the same
daisyUI semantic tokens `theme.css` defines**, so a chart inherits
`data-theme="brand"` with zero extra theming — light and dark for free.

Write `charts.md` with a themed example for the prototype:

**prototype (CDN, no build):**

```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/apexcharts"></script>
<div id="sales"></div>
<script>
const css = (v) =>
  getComputedStyle(document.documentElement).getPropertyValue(v).trim();
new ApexCharts(document.getElementById("sales"), {
  chart: {
    type: "area",
    height: 260,
    fontFamily: "<Display>, sans-serif",
    toolbar: { show: false },
  },
  series: [{ name: "Ventas", data: [31, 40, 28, 51, 42, 68] }],
  colors: [css("--color-primary")], // resolves from data-theme
  stroke: { curve: "smooth", width: 3 },
  dataLabels: { enabled: false },
  fill: { type: "gradient", gradient: { opacityFrom: .4, opacityTo: .05 } },
}).render();
</script>
```

Read the theme colors with `getComputedStyle` (they resolve to the hex/oklch in
`theme.cdn.css`). Don't pass an unresolved `var(--color-…)` or a raw
`color-mix(...)` string straight into ApexCharts' JS color array — read the
computed value first, or use a concrete shade.

### Shade derivation

Charts that need tints (a lighter slice, a faded grid line) use the
`color-mix()` shade tokens from `theme.css` (`--color-base-content-30`, etc.) or
daisyUI opacity utilities — never the runtime-JS injection the upstream package
uses.

### Folding in the library itself (optional)

If the user wants the artifact self-sufficient, copy the `daisyui-charts` skill
folder (`skills/daisyui-charts/<type>/` — the per-type `SKILL.md` + chart `.md`
recipes) into the artifact and reference it from `charts.md`. If you only fold
in the _patterns_ (the default), say so plainly in `charts.md` — don't reference
`skills/daisyui-charts/` paths that aren't actually present.
