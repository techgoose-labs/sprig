name: "sprig:breakdown"
description: >-
  Decompose a UI mock into a build-ready spec — page inventory, shared/page-local
  components, design tokens, the contract binding (component → endpoint → DTO
  against the ratified backend contract; the implied data model only when no
  contract exists), the interaction-tier map
  (which regions are static vs islands) with feedback and
  liveness, motion specs with jank findings, cropped screenshots and animation
  filmstrips, and ready-to-drop-in isolate fixture proposals — so a sprig +
  isolate build session can rebuild the UI mechanically. Use whenever the user points at a mock, prototype,
  reference UI, or finished HTML/screenshot/PDF design and wants it broken down,
  spec'd out, decomposed, reverse-engineered, or turned into components —
  phrases like "break this down", "do a ui-breakdown", "spec this mock", "turn
  this into components", "prep this for the rebuild". Trigger even when they
  don't say "spec": pointing at an HTML mock and asking how to rebuild it in
  sprig counts.

# breakdown — orchestrate mock → build spec

> **Pipeline stage — breakdown.** Consumes `prototype`
> (`../interfaces/prototype.md`); produces the `ui-breakdown` contract
> (`../interfaces/ui-breakdown.md`), consumed by `build`. Full chain: design →
> prototype → breakdown → build → audit.

Produce a `spec/ui/breakdown/` directory a later build session can work through
**mechanically**: scaffold a component, drop in its proposed `isolate/`, run
`sprig isolate`, diff against the screenshots, write tests from the Events
section, repeat. The spec must let someone rebuild each page/component **without
opening the source** — judge every decision by that standard.

**You are the orchestrator. You don't survey, render, or write specs yourself —
you delegate each pass to a named specialist**, hand it its input contract, and
chain the artifacts. The rebuild target is **sprig** (Deno SSR, Angular-flavored
templates, folder-components, island hydration, Tailwind v4) — **not
Fresh/Preact/Next/Angular**; source JS/CSS is reference ground truth, not
deliverable.

## The specialists you delegate to

| Agent                             | Pass                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | Returns                                                                  |
| --------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **`sprig-breakdown-analyst`**     | survey, page+component census, static/island classification + tiers, `design-tokens.md`, the contract **binding** (`spec/contract/binding.md`; legacy `data-model.md` when no contract) (opening); `index.md` + completeness audit (closing) | the written docs + a structured **inventory** of pages/components        |
| **`sprig-breakdown-capture`**     | render the mock: cropped stills, breakpoint/theme shots, motion extraction, filmstrips, `jank.md`, jank lints, extracted `js/`/`css/`                                                                                                        | evidence files + extracted motion specs, jank findings, real data values |
| **`sprig-breakdown-spec-writer`** | per component/page: the `.md` anatomy + the real runnable `isolate/` fixtures                                                                                                                                                                | the unit's spec files + case list                                        |

Each specialist owns its own procedure — **do not restate the classification
rubric, capture recipes, or component anatomy here.** They live in the agents
and in `references/{capture-recipes,isolate-format}.md` (the agents read them).

## Input & output

- **Input** — the prototype this skill consumes: by default the two-seam
  `spec/ui/<app>-prototype/` folder (glob `spec/ui/*-prototype/`; legacy
  `spec/ui/*-prototype.html`). If the user points at a different mock (any
  HTML/screenshot/PDF), use that. When a ratified contract exists at the git
  root (`spec/contract/`, or `spec/runes/*.rune`), it is ALSO input — the data
  seam binds against it (bridge 2).
- **Output** — always `<git-root>/spec/ui/breakdown/`, and nowhere else. Resolve
  the git root **once** with `git rev-parse --show-toplevel` and build the path
  from it (`"$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)"/spec/ui/breakdown`); create
  `spec/ui/` if absent. Derive the path automatically; never ask. Every artifact
  this skill and its agents produce — the `.md` specs, `isolate/` folders, and
  **every screenshot / filmstrip PNG** — lives under that one directory. The
  directory shape is the `ui-breakdown` contract
  (`../interfaces/ui-breakdown.md`).
- **NEVER search the filesystem for a breakdown artifact.** You always know
  where it is: under `<git-root>/spec/ui/breakdown/`. Do not run `find /`,
  `find ~`, or any whole-disk / home-dir scan to locate a screenshot or output
  file — that pins every CPU core for minutes. If a file you expect isn't at its
  known path, it wasn't written there; re-derive the path from the git root or
  re-run the step that writes it. Scope any legitimate lookup to
  `<git-root>/spec/ui/breakdown` (e.g.
  `find "$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)/spec/ui/breakdown" -name '*.png'`).

## The flow

1. **Analyze (opening).** Delegate to **`sprig-breakdown-analyst`** (phase
   `opening`) with the source + output dir → it surveys, does the page/component
   census, classifies every region (static vs island vs page-composition, with
   tiers), and writes `design-tokens.md`
   - the contract **binding** (`spec/contract/binding.md`; legacy
     `data-model.md` when no contract exists). Take its **inventory** (every
     page/component with classification, tier, shared/local, renderable?, and
     its resolved absolute `breakdown_dir`) and surface any **drift errors** it
     reports. The inventory's paths are what you pass downstream — capture and
     spec-writers receive their unit dirs resolved, never a name to go find.
2. **Capture** (renderable sources only). Resolve the SERVE facts ONCE — the
   serve command (`deno task start` for a two-seam prototype; `file://` for a
   legacy mock) and a PORT per agent — and pass them in each brief. Then for the
   renderable units in the inventory, delegate to **`sprig-breakdown-capture`**
   (fan out per unit/group) → stills/breakpoints/ themes, extracted motion
   specs, filmstrips, `jank.md`, jank findings, **each unit's `source.html`
   markup excerpt** plus extracted `js/`/`css/`, and the real captured data
   values. The excerpts are load-bearing: they are the only markup spec-writers
   read. (Skip for image/PDF sources — there's nothing to render.)
3. **Write specs.** For each component and page, delegate to
   **`sprig-breakdown-spec-writer`** with that unit's classification (from step
   1), its **Used-on line from the analyst's usage matrix** (the anatomy needs
   it — an unbriefed writer globs sibling units to derive it), and its
   UNIT-LOCAL evidence (from step 2 — **the unit's file list copied verbatim
   from capture's return**) → its `<name>.md` (anatomy + Isolate build plan) and
   its real, runnable `isolate/` folder. Spec-writers never open the full mock
   (a measured fleet re-read a 137KB prototype 207 times). **ONE unit per
   instance — never batch even tiny siblings**: a batched brief can't carry
   every unit's evidence list within budget (measured: the one batched writer in
   a fleet was the only one to glob-hunt and bust its prompt budget); the
   4–6-concurrent waves are what keep the agent count sane, not batching.
4. **Close.** Delegate to **`sprig-breakdown-analyst`** (phase `closing`) with
   the list of specs produced → `index.md` (inventory, usage matrix, build
   order, tier summary, Unassigned) + the completeness audit. The **Unassigned
   list ships even when empty.**

Independent units within steps 2 and 3 run concurrently — **capped at 4–6
concurrent, in chunked waves**
(`for (const wave of chunks(units, 5)) await parallel(…)` in a Workflow).
Measured on real fleets: 10+ concurrent agents saturate the org's
tokens-per-minute quota, die on 429/529, and re-execute from scratch; if a wave
still dies of rate limits, halve the chunk before resuming. Respect that step 3
needs step 1's classification and step 2's evidence for each unit. Specialists
are pinned in their defs (analyst = opus judgment; capture/spec-writer = sonnet)
— don't override to `inherit`. Collect compact per-unit returns; run a big
breakdown in a fresh session.

## Source-type routing

- **Self-contained HTML / folder of HTML files** — the full pipeline above.
- **Images / PDF** — visual analysis only: tell the analyst to describe instead
  of extract, **skip the capture stage entirely**, and tell the spec-writer to
  mark every inferred section "described, not extracted — verify during build"
  and never fabricate evidence. Scale the whole output to the evidence available
  (one screenshot → one page folder).

## Rules

- **You delegate; you do not perform a pass.** Hand each specialist its contract
  and summarize its return between hops.
- **Orchestrator conduct:** after spawning agents, END YOUR TURN — task
  notifications re-invoke you; never `sleep`-poll between passes. Never search
  the filesystem yourself (skill references live at exact
  `~/.claude/skills/<skill>/references/` paths).
- **Brief completely — a specialist that searches was under-briefed.** Every
  path you pass is absolute and copied verbatim from a stage return (the
  analyst's inventory, capture's file lists) — never retyped, never "glob for
  it". A specialist reporting `blocked: missing path` means the brief was wrong:
  fix the brief and re-delegate.
- Classify by **does it need a `logic.ts`**, not "interactive vs not": default
  **static**, justify every island, spec server writes as **optimistic UI**
  (snapshot → mutate → call → roll back). Performance is the build's job; here
  only flag expensive data _shapes_.
- Page-local by default; promote to `shared-components/` only with evidence.
- **Bind, don't re-derive** (bridge 2): with a ratified contract at the git
  root, every data-need binds to a real endpoint + DTO in
  `spec/contract/binding.md`; a mismatch is a **drift error** surfaced in
  `index.md`, never papered over with an invented schema.
- **Extract over describe** wherever the source is readable; schema (never data
  rows) in the binding / legacy `data-model.md` and prose — case JSON is the one
  place real captured values belong.
- Proposed `isolate/` folders are **real files** `sprig isolate` discovers, not
  docs.
- The `index.md` audit list ships even when empty ("Unassigned: none").
