# isolate fixture format — what a valid proposal looks like

The format `sprig isolate` discovers (see `sprig:build` →
`references/isolate.md`). A proposed `isolate/` folder must be discoverable
unchanged — `sprig isolate` fails fast on malformed fixtures, so an invalid
proposal is worse than none.

## Component = folder, not a file

A sprig component is a **folder**: `template.html` + an optional `logic.ts` (its
presence makes the folder an **island** that hydrates) + an optional
`styles.css`. **There is no `.tsx` file.** The folder's **basename is its
selector** — the custom tag other templates use (`command-palette/` →
`<command-palette>`). Propose kebab-case folder names that read as the tag you
spec'd.

## Folder shape

The build session places each component at one of three `src/` roots — your
**Classification** decides which:

| Classification            | Lands in             | Routes under    |
| ------------------------- | -------------------- | --------------- |
| `static` (no `logic.ts`)  | `components/<name>/` | `/components/…` |
| `island` (has `logic.ts`) | `islands/<name>/`    | `/components/…` |
| `page-composition`        | `pages/<name>/`      | `/pages/…`      |

```
islands/counter/
  template.html                ← the view (Angular-flavored bindings)
  logic.ts                     ← defineComponent({ setup }) — makes it an island
  styles.css                   ← (optional) view-encapsulated styles
  isolate/
    fixture.json               ← metadata + control declarations
    cases/
      three/
        three.json             ← cases/<name>/<name>.json — names MUST match
        tests/*.spec.ts        ← (build session writes these from your Events section)
```

## `fixture.json`

```jsonc
{
  "category": "overlays", // gallery group + URL segment (default: folder name)
  "folder": "modal", // optional sub-group + URL segment
  "background": "#f4f5f7", // optional stage background

  // Controls for the top-level component — one per Props-table row.
  "controls": {
    "open": { "type": "boolean", "value": true, "signal": true },
    "title": { "type": "text", "value": "Delete workspace?" },
    "tone": {
      "type": "select",
      "options": ["default", "danger"],
      "value": "danger"
    }
  },

  // Optional: controls for sub-components the component renders, keyed by the
  // sub-component's SELECTOR (its folder basename / custom tag).
  "components": {
    "ui-button": { "controls": { "disabled": { "type": "boolean" } } }
  }
}
```

The preview route is `/<components|pages>/<category>/<folder>/<case>` (e.g.
`/components/overlays/modal/danger-open`).

Control `type` values — each Props-table row maps to exactly one:

| `type`    | Widget       | Extra fields         |
| --------- | ------------ | -------------------- |
| `boolean` | checkbox     | —                    |
| `number`  | number input | —                    |
| `text`    | text input   | —                    |
| `range`   | slider       | `min`, `max`, `step` |
| `select`  | dropdown     | `options: [...]`     |
| `color`   | color picker | —                    |

- Any control may carry a default `value`.
- **`"signal": true`** routes the value in as a **sprig signal** — use it for
  island state a reviewer will toggle live (it survives a control-edit remount;
  a plain value does not). Mirror the `signal?` column of your Props table.
- A bare value (`"size": "md"`) is shorthand for `{ "value": "md" }` with the
  widget inferred.

## Case JSON — `cases/<state>/<state>.json`

One case per row of the component's **States → cases** table. Bare keys are
props; `_`-prefixed keys are specials:

| Key          | Effect                                                          |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| _(bare key)_ | passed as a prop / `@input`                                     |
| `_name`      | human label for the case (default: folder name)                 |
| `_innerHtml` | the component's projected children (sprig `<content>`)          |
| `_signals`   | `{ name: value }` seeded as island signals (the island's state) |
| `_mocks`     | stub or force props on sub-components, keyed by **selector**    |

```jsonc
// cases/default/default.json
{ "_name": "Default", "title": "Save changes?", "tone": "default" }

// cases/danger-open/danger-open.json — island state via signals
{ "_name": "Danger, open", "tone": "danger", "_signals": { "open": true } }

// cases/stubbed/stubbed.json — isolate from a heavy child by selector
{ "_name": "Chart stubbed", "_mocks": { "sparkline": "stub" } }

// force props on every instance of a child (keyed by selector)
{ "_mocks": { "ui-button": { "props": { "disabled": true } } } }
```

`_mocks[selector]` accepts `"stub"` (labelled placeholder) or
`{ "props": {...} }` (force those props on every instance of that
sub-component).

**Case values are the real captured data.** The build session diffs the rendered
case against your screenshot — so the case must reproduce exactly what the
screenshot shows (actual titles, names, dates, ids, series). For large data
sets, carry the exact visible slice, not the full set and not invented
lookalikes.

## Events → test predicates

isolate's test bridge (`isolate-events`) exposes every DOM event a component
fires as `IsolateEvent = { time, source, type, detail }` — `source` is `tag` or
`tag#id` (`"button#submit"`, `"input#email"`), `detail` carries the input value
/ pressed key / element label. In the **interactive workbench** (`sprig isolate`
in a browser) a spec can read them via:

```ts
import { capture, waitHydrated } from "isolate-events";

const ev = await capture(page); // install BEFORE page.goto
await page.goto("/components/overlays/modal/danger-open");
await waitHydrated(page); // a click before hydration is a silent no-op
await page.locator("#confirm").click();
await ev.expect((e) => e.source === "button#confirm" && e.type === "click", {
  timeout: 3000,
});
```

**Headless caveat — what actually runs under `isolate test`.** The headless
runner executes specs with **Node** Playwright: `@std/expect` and every other
Deno-only specifier fail to load (the run reports `ran: false, total: 0` and
names the import). The `isolate-events` helpers (`capture`/`waitHydrated`) DO
fire there — the stage-bridge produces both signals under direct navigation. A
runnable case test is plain Playwright:

```ts
import { expect, test } from "@playwright/test";
import { waitHydrated } from "isolate-events";

// The runner exposes the preview server as ISOLATE_BASE_URL; no config sets a baseURL.
const BASE = process.env.ISOLATE_BASE_URL ?? "http://127.0.0.1:8000";

test("confirm closes the modal", async ({ page }) => {
  await page.goto(`${BASE}/components/overlays/modal/danger-open`);
  // islands hydrate async — waitHydrated resolves once the target island's scope is
  // attached AND the case's _signals are applied (statics: immediately)
  await waitHydrated(page);
  await page.locator("#confirm").click();
  await expect(page.locator(".modal")).toBeHidden(); // the observable effect
});
```

Write each row of a component's **Events** section as a predicate sketch against
the real `source`/`type`/`detail` values you observed — the build session lifts
the predicate into `tests/*.spec.ts`, either via `capture(page)` (call it BEFORE
`page.goto`) asserting the bridge event itself, or as the event's observable DOM
effect.

## Gotchas to encode in proposals

- **Route ≠ directory.** The preview URL is
  `/<components|pages>/<category>/<folder>/<case>` from `fixture.json`, not the
  source path. Don't write specs that assume path-derived URLs.
- **Editing a control remounts the stage** — `setup()` re-runs and its plain
  local state resets; **signal-backed** state (`signal: true` controls /
  `_signals` cases) survives. Prefer signal-backed for anything a reviewer will
  toggle while inspecting state.
- **Hydration is async** — interacting before it completes is a silent no-op;
  gate island interactions on `waitHydrated(page)` (interactive workbench) or
  the `sprig-island[data-sel="…"][data-sprig-hydrated]` selector wait above
  (headless `isolate test`).
- Props crossing into an island must be **serializable** — no functions, no
  class instances. If the source passes a callback, redesign the prop as an
  event the island emits (`ctx.output`) and note it in the Events section.
