# Playwright MCP recipes — driving the live app to find bugs & perf issues

Copy-adaptable call sequences for the discovery passes. The Playwright **MCP**
is one shared browser session — you are its only driver until the parallel-RCA
pass. `browser_evaluate` (run a function in the page, get JSON back) is the
workhorse for everything the dedicated tools don't cover.

`browser_snapshot` (the accessibility tree) is both your structural census
**and** an a11y finding source — missing names/roles/labels show up here. Prefer
it over a screenshot when you need _refs_ to click.

## Booting & sizing

Start the server fresh in the shell (`sprig dev` on a known port, or the prod
build `sprig serve` — see SKILL pass 0), then:

1. `browser_resize` to a desktop viewport (e.g. 1280×800) so the first sweep is
   consistent.
2. `browser_navigate` to the app root.
3. Immediately drain console + network (below). The first paint is where boot
   errors, 500s, and asset 404s surface.

## Console & network health

After **every** navigation and interaction, drain both — these are free
findings:

- `browser_console_messages` → triage by level. `error` is a finding. Watch
  specifically for **SSR/hydration throws** — an unguarded `window`/`document`
  in a `setup()` (throws during SSR → a controlled 500), a _"DI does not cross
  the SSR/island boundary"_ throw, or a client `setup()` error that leaves an
  island un-hydrated (renders but never reacts).
- `browser_network_requests` → any `4xx`/`5xx` is a finding (failed API call,
  404'd asset, soft-error). Note the document request's own status for the
  status-code check below.

## Status codes — the soft-404 trap

**The MCP `browser_navigate` does not cleanly hand you the HTTP status**, and
the DOM can't tell a real 404 from a 200 that _looks_ like one. Two reliable
probes:

1. **From the shell (best for the verify step too):**
   `curl -i http://localhost:8000/ui/blog/does-not-exist | head -1` → expect
   `HTTP/1.1 404`. A 200 here on a "not found" page is a soft 404 (the resolver
   never called `setResponseStatus(404)`). Off-base paths (incl. a bare `/` when
   `base` is `/ui`) 404 by design.
2. **In-page, no extra navigation cost:** after navigating, read the document
   request's status from the network log, or probe directly:

   ```js
   // browser_evaluate
   (async () => {
     const r = await fetch(location.pathname, { redirect: "manual" });
     return { status: r.status, type: r.type, redirected: r.redirected };
   });
   ```

Check this for every "error/empty" state a story implies (unknown id, gated
route). Auth bounces are the redirect version: expect a `302`/`303` to `/login`,
not a 200 render of the protected page.

## Island hydration check

The bug is _renders but doesn't react_. Never assert on visibility — assert that
**interacting changes the DOM** (after hydration; a click before hydrate is a
silent no-op against the SSR markup):

1. `browser_snapshot` to get the island's element ref.
2. Read a value (label/aria/state), e.g. `browser_evaluate`
   `() => document.querySelector("#count")?.textContent`.
3. `browser_click` (or type) the control. (If the island's `trigger` is
   `visible`/`interaction`/`idle`, first do the thing that fires it — scroll it
   into view / hover it — so its chunk loads.)
4. Re-read. **No change = dead island.** Then check the console (an
   SSR/hydration throw?) and the source for the cause class: the folder has **no
   `logic.ts`** (so it's static and `(event)`s never fire), a **non-serializable
   `@input`** (a function/class-instance prop dropped on the wire), or an
   unguarded browser global in `setup()`. Confirm hydration even ran — the
   island chunks should be in the network:

   ```js
   // browser_evaluate — did island chunks load at all?
   (() =>
     performance.getEntriesByType("resource")
       .map((r) => r.name).filter((n) =>
         /\/(isl\.|chunk-|client)\b.*\.js/.test(n)
       ));
   ```

## Writes (optimistic actions) & validation

sprig has no PRG forms — a server write is an **optimistic island action**.
Drive it and assert the optimistic behavior, not a redirect:

1. Read the value the action changes, then `browser_click` / `browser_type` /
   `browser_fill_form`.
2. Assert the UI updates **immediately** (optimistic) — no spinner-and-wait, and
   crucially **no `location.reload()`** to re-read server state.
3. Force a failure (e.g. block the `/api/*` request via
   `browser_network_request` abort, or feed input the backend rejects) → the UI
   should **roll back** to the prior value and surface an error, not keep the
   optimistic state.
4. Check **server-side validation** independently of the client:
   `curl -i -X POST` bad data straight to the `/api/…` endpoint → expect a
   rejection (4xx), no write. Missing server validation is a finding even if the
   island hides it client-side.

## Performance instrumentation

Install observers via `browser_evaluate` **before** triggering, then read them
after. One combined installer:

```js
// browser_evaluate — install once after navigation
(() => {
  const S =
    (window.__audit = { longtasks: [], loaf: [], cls: 0, lcp: 0, inp: 0 });
  const obs = (type, cb) => {
    try {
      new PerformanceObserver((l) => l.getEntries().forEach(cb)).observe({
        type,
        buffered: true,
      });
    } catch {}
  };
  obs("longtask", (e) => S.longtasks.push(Math.round(e.duration)));
  obs("long-animation-frame", (e) => S.loaf.push(Math.round(e.duration)));
  obs("layout-shift", (e) => {
    if (!e.hadRecentInput) S.cls += e.value;
  });
  obs("largest-contentful-paint", (e) => S.lcp = Math.round(e.startTime));
  obs("event", (e) => {
    const d = e.duration;
    if (d > S.inp) S.inp = Math.round(d);
  });
  return "installed";
});
```

```js
// browser_evaluate — read after interacting
(() => {
  const S = window.__audit || {};
  const nav = performance.getEntriesByType("navigation")[0] || {};
  return {
    ttfb: Math.round(nav.responseStart || 0),
    domContentLoaded: Math.round(nav.domContentLoadedEventEnd || 0),
    load: Math.round(nav.loadEventEnd || 0),
    lcp: S.lcp,
    cls: +(S.cls || 0).toFixed(3),
    inpWorst: S.inp || 0,
    longtasks: S.longtasks || [],
    loaf: S.loaf || [],
  };
});
```

Thresholds that make a number a finding are in `sprig-bug-catalog.md` (perf
half). Report each reading as one labeled sample with the trigger, not a
benchmark.

## Jank under interaction

Measure frames across a real interaction (scroll/hover/drag/open):

```js
// browser_evaluate — start a frame-delta recorder
(() => {
  const A = (window.__frames = { d: [], last: performance.now() });
  requestAnimationFrame(function t(n) {
    A.d.push(n - A.last);
    A.last = n;
    if (A.d.length < 240) requestAnimationFrame(t);
  });
  return "recording";
});
```

Trigger the interaction (`browser_mouse`-style via `browser_evaluate`
`window.scrollBy(...)`, or `browser_hover`/`browser_drag`/`browser_press_key`),
wait ~1 s (`browser_wait_for`), then:

```js
// browser_evaluate — read jank
(() => {
  const d = (window.__frames?.d) || [], f = 1000 / 60;
  return {
    frames: d.length,
    dropped: +(d.filter((x) => x > 1.5 * f).length / d.length).toFixed(2),
    maxFrameMs: Math.round(Math.max(0, ...d)),
  };
});
```

A high dropped-frame % under interaction is the symptom; correlate to the cause
class (CSS layout-prop animation, JS forced-sync-layout) in the catalog.

## Animation specs

Extract real animation params instead of describing them (catches
layout-property animations and `transition: all`):

```js
// browser_evaluate — declarative (CSS/WAAPI) animations only
(() =>
  document.getAnimations().map((a) => ({
    kind: a.constructor.name,
    name: a.animationName ?? a.transitionProperty ?? null,
    props: (a.effect?.getKeyframes?.() || []).flatMap((k) =>
      Object.keys(k).filter((p) =>
        !["offset", "easing", "composite"].includes(p)
      )
    ),
    duration: a.effect?.getComputedTiming?.().duration,
  })));
```

`getAnimations()` is **blind to rAF/canvas** animation — find those by reading
the island/component source for `requestAnimationFrame`, manual `style.*` writes
in scroll handlers, and canvas draw loops. For deterministic frame capture of
rAF-driven motion, `browser_run_code_unsafe` can `page.clock.install()` if the
tool is enabled; otherwise capture live with the frame recorder above.

**Layout-thrash hunt (code-side, hand to the RCA agent):** grep the
island/handler source for layout reads (`offsetTop`, `offsetHeight`,
`scrollTop`, `getBoundingClientRect`, `getComputedStyle`) **inside**
scroll/`rAF`/resize handlers — worst as a per-element loop. That forces
synchronous layout every frame.

## Network waterfall

`browser_network_requests` after a full page load gives you the list. Flag:

- any `4xx`/`5xx`;
- a slow **document** TTFB (a slow in-process backend `fetch` blocking SSR — a
  backend finding, traced server-side in pass 4);
- oversized/uncompressed assets, missing `cache-control`;
- serial chains that should be parallel (request B waits on A for no reason).

For a deeper look, read response timing via `browser_evaluate`
`performance.getEntriesByType("resource").map(r => ({ name: r.name, dur:
Math.round(r.duration), size: r.transferSize }))`.

## Breakpoints

Read the source's real `@media` widths (don't guess device sizes) and
`browser_resize` to each, re-running the smoke + a screenshot. Common build
finding: a layout that collapses or a bottom-tab-bar that overlaps content at
the small breakpoint, or a hover-only affordance with no touch equivalent.
