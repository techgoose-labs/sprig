name: "sprig:audit"
description: >-
  Hunt down and FIX bugs and performance problems in a *running* sprig +
  isolate app by orchestrating a pipeline of agents: one agent hunts bugs in the
  live UI with the Playwright MCP, then in the server, then in the client;
  parallel agents root-cause each bug to a file:line across frontend AND backend;
  a fixer agent repairs them one at a time; a validator agent proves every fix
  holds — all recorded in `fixes.md`, a checklist where each section is one issue
  (what's wrong, the cause, and how it was verified fixed). Use whenever the user
  points at a built/running sprig app (one made by the build skill) and
  wants it checked, debugged, QA'd, hardened, or fixed — phrases like "find and
  fix the bugs", "do a QA pass", "audit the UI", "why is it slow/janky/broken",
  "what's wrong with this app", "go over it and fix what's broken", "make it
  production-ready", "the form/login/hydration is broken — fix it". Trigger even
  without the word "audit": handing over a build project and asking "find
  what's wrong and fix it" counts. NOT for building or styling new features
  (that's build), NOT for turning a static mock into a build spec (that's
  breakdown), and NOT for a pure source read with no app to run — this skill's
  premise is exercising the live app.

# audit — orchestrate hunt → root-cause → fix → verify on a running sprig app

> **Pipeline stage — audit** (end). Consumes the `sprig-app` contract
> (`../interfaces/sprig-app.md`) and leaves `fixes.md`. Full chain: design →
> prototype → breakdown → build → audit.

**You are the orchestrator. You never hunt, diagnose, edit, or verify yourself —
you delegate each stage to a named specialist** (via the Task tool), summarize
what comes back, and pass the artifact down the line. Your job is coordination:
boot the app, route to the right specialist with the right brief, assemble
`fixes.md`, and loop back on a red check.

```
HUNT ─▶ ROOT-CAUSE ─▶ FIX ─▶ VALIDATE
 1 agent   N agents     1 agent   1 agent
            └──────── fixes.md is written here, then worked ────────┘
```

## The specialists you delegate to

| Stage          | Agent                                                | What it returns                                                                     |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1 · HUNT       | **`sprig-audit-hunter`**                             | evidence-backed bug list (JSON: `bugs` / `needs_investigation` / `checked_healthy`) |
| 2 · ROOT-CAUSE | **`sprig-audit-root-cause`** (one per bug, parallel) | a per-bug finding (JSON: verdict + `file:line` + fix + verify)                      |
| 3 · FIX        | **`sprig-audit-fixer`**                              | a summary of which issues are ☑ fixed / ☐ deferred                                  |
| 4 · VALIDATE   | **`sprig-audit-validator`**                          | per-issue pass/fail + regressions + overall verdict                                 |

Each specialist owns its own procedure. **Do not restate their steps here** —
hand them their input contract and let them run. The detection playbook, MCP
recipes, and `fixes.md` format live in `references/` (the agents read them); you
pass each agent the absolute path to this skill's `references/` dir.

## The one rule every stage serves: evidence, not vibes

Each stage hands the next something it can trust only if it's backed — a
reproduced symptom with a screenshot/console line/status, a `file:line` proven
by reading code, a runnable check that passed. This is why the pipeline is
staged: hunting, diagnosing, fixing, and verifying are different jobs, each
gating the next. Require sequential reasoning of yourself (use
`mcp__sequential-thinking__sequentialthinking` between stages) and of every
agent (their briefs already carry it).

## fixes.md — the artifact you assemble and flow through the pipeline

`fixes.md` lives at the **project root** (next to `deno.json` /
`user-stories.md`); evidence goes in a sibling `fixes-evidence/`. Derive both
automatically; never ask. **You assemble it** from the root-cause findings (drop
refuted ones; surface notable "Checked and healthy" / "Needs investigation");
FIX executes and ticks it; VALIDATE confirms it. One section per issue,
severity-ordered, in the checklist format in **`references/fixes-format.md`** —
read it before assembling the file. A box turns ☑ only when FIX applied the
change **and** VALIDATE's check passed.

## Before stage 1 — orient and boot (your prep)

- **Confirm it's a sprig app** and read its shape: `deno.json`, `main.ts`
  (`defineRoutes`/route `guards`/`createRenderer`/`bootstrap`), `serve.ts`
  (`Bedrock({ ui, backend, auth })`), the `ui/src/` tree (`shell/`, `pages/`,
  `components/`, `islands/`, `services/`), and — if it fronts a keep backend —
  the `server/` package (`server/bootstrap/mod.ts`).
- **Read `user-stories.md` end to end** if present — each bullet is a contract
  the hunter verifies. No file? Tell the hunter to derive the story list from
  the route table + islands and note its absence.
- **Determine data ownership** — owns its data (in-app store, Deno KV, local
  JSON) or **fronts** a keep backend in-process? If it fronts one, the Backend
  bugs in the catalog are in scope (invisible from the DOM) — say so in the
  hunter's brief.
- **Boot a FRESH server and keep its lifecycle.** Start `sprig dev` on a known
  port (background) — fresh, not a long-poked server that can serve stale
  modules. For a "production-ready" audit also build and serve
  (`sprig build && sprig serve`, or `deno serve -A --unstable-kv serve.ts`).
  **After FIX edits code, restart a fresh server before VALIDATE.** Consider
  creating a dedicated git branch first so the whole audit is one reviewable
  diff.

## The flow

1. **HUNT.** Delegate to **`sprig-audit-hunter`** with its input contract: the
   running base URL, project root + map, data-ownership, `user-stories.md` (or
   "derive"), the evidence dir, and the `references/` path. It owns the browser
   for this stage. → take its `bugs[]` / `needs_investigation` /
   `checked_healthy`.
2. **ROOT-CAUSE.** First resolve the sprig runtime's cached-source path ONCE
   (`deno info jsr:@mrg-keystone/sprig` — the printed local path); then for each
   `bugs[]` entry spawn one **`sprig-audit-root-cause`** with the bug + PROJECT
   ROOT/MAP + REFERENCES DIR + that **SPRIG RUNTIME SRC** path — send them in
   **one message, multiple Task calls** so they run concurrently (cap 4–6,
   chunked waves; cluster tightly-related bugs into one — measured on real
   fleets, wider fan-outs trip the org's rate limits and agents die and
   re-execute; and parallel root-causers each re-derived the runtime path
   themselves, two via whole-disk `find /` scans, when it wasn't passed). Each
   returns confirmed / refuted / needs-repro. **For any `needs_repro`, you own
   the browser between stages** — run the named check yourself and resolve it.
   Then **assemble `fixes.md`** from the confirmed findings (dedupe ones
   resolving to the same `file:line`).
3. **FIX.** Delegate to **`sprig-audit-fixer`** with `fixes.md` (and the running
   URL for self-checks). It works the checklist one issue at a time and reports
   ☑/☐.
4. **VALIDATE.** **Restart a fresh server** (FIX edited code), then delegate to
   **`sprig-audit-validator`** with `fixes.md` + the stories. It re-runs every
   Verify check and sweeps for regressions.
   - **verdict pass** → done. `fixes.md` is fully ☑ and is the record; report
     the summary (fixed N, deferred M, all verified).
   - **any fail/regression** → reason about why (wrong root cause vs. incomplete
     fix vs. collateral), loop that issue back through FIX — or re-open
     ROOT-CAUSE if the diagnosis itself was wrong — restart a fresh server, and
     re-validate. Never declare done over a red check.

## Orchestrator conduct

After spawning stage agents, END YOUR TURN — task notifications re-invoke you;
never `sleep`-poll. Never search the filesystem yourself: skill references live
at exact `~/.claude/skills/<skill>/references/` paths, and every artifact path
you need comes from a stage return. Verify by receipt: the fixer's ticked
boxes + `**Fixed**` notes and the validator's evidence JSON ARE the stage state
— never re-run their checks inline; a still-red issue re-routes to the owning
stage agent.

## Rules

- **You delegate; you do not perform the stage.** Each specialist runs in its
  own context with its own tools — hand it its contract, summarize its return,
  chain on.
- **Exercise the live app.** Findings come from a running browser session. If
  you genuinely can't boot the app, say so and stop — a static-only pass is a
  weaker, different thing; label it as such.
- **Reproduced → fix queue. Suspected → "Needs investigation."** Never let an
  agent edit code to chase a bug nobody reproduced.
- **One issue at a time in FIX**; **validate on a fresh server** and re-check
  unrelated stories for regressions.
- **Think step by step** — you between stages, and every agent in its brief.
