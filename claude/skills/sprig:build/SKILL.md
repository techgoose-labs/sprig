  Expert guidance for building web apps with sprig — a Deno SSR framework with
  Angular-flavored HTML templates and selective island hydration, published on JSR as
  @techgoose-labs/sprig. Use this whenever the user is scaffolding, building, or modifying a sprig
  app: adding pages or components, islands (interactive components), wiring data with a
  page's logic.ts class or resolve, routes, route guards (auth redirects), persisted state,
  dependency injection, or
  previewing/testing a component in isolation with `sprig isolate`; or when working in a
  repo with sprig markers (a deno.json importing "jsr:@techgoose-labs/sprig", folder-components made
  of template.html + optional logic.ts, a ui/src/ tree with pages/ + a shell, or main.ts
  calling bootstrap()/createRenderer()). sprig is NOT Fresh/Preact, Next.js, or Angular —
  it borrows Angular's template syntax but is its own runtime, so prefer this skill over
  memory of those frameworks. Do NOT use for Fresh, React/Next, Vue, Svelte, plain Deno
  scripts with no web server, or unrelated uses of "sprig".

sprig is a **Deno server-rendered** framework: Angular-flavored HTML templates
parsed at build time, every page rendered to HTML on the server, JavaScript
shipped **only for islands** (folders with a `logic.ts`). A component is a
**folder** (`template.html` + optional `logic.ts` + `styles.css`), **not a
`.tsx`** — there is no JSX, no filesystem routing, no Vite, no manifest. It
borrows Angular's _syntax_, not its runtime. This "not-Fresh/Next/Angular"
framing is the single biggest source of bugs — keep it front of mind when
routing work and remind every specialist of it.

**You are the orchestrator. You do not write app code inline — you delegate
building to a named specialist** and coordinate the order, the running servers,
and the iteration loop. (The one exception: a _pure conceptual question_ with no
file to produce — "how do islands hydrate?" — you may answer by reading the
relevant `references/` leaf yourself. Anything that creates or edits code is
delegated.)

## The specialists you delegate to

| Agent                        | Owns                                                                                                                                                  | Reads                                                                                                                                                 |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **`sprig-build-scaffolder`** | app skeleton: `sprig init`, `main.ts` routes/renderer/bootstrap, `serve.ts` host, the shell, `ui/src/css-variables.json` tokens, the prod-build smoke | `references/routing.md`, `references/serving.md`                                                                                                      |
| **`sprig-build-component`**  | building ONE component/page/island to green in isolation (template + `logic.ts` + scoped styles + `isolate/` cases + the diff/test loop)              | `references/component-model.md`, `references/templates.md`, `references/isolate.md`, and (cross-skill) `sprig:breakdown/references/isolate-format.md` |

Each specialist owns its own procedure — **do not restate their steps here.**
Pass each one its input contract and summarize what it returns.

## Where to start (the three entry modes)

- **No args, app already built** (runnable `ui/src/`, nothing pending in
  `spec/ui/breakdown/` or `spec/ui/build-notes.json`) → enter the **annotate
  review loop** (below).
- **No args, pending work** — a `spec/ui/breakdown/` to implement, or a
  `spec/ui/build-notes.json` with open entries → do that work (implement the
  spec component-by-component, or apply the notes), then fall back to the
  annotate loop.
- **With args** (add a page/component/island, wire data, fix X) → route to the
  right specialist, then verify by running it.

## The flow

1. **Skeleton first.** If the app isn't stood up (or routes/serving/tokens need
   wiring), delegate to **`sprig-build-scaffolder`** with the project root, the
   routes to register (from the breakdown `index.md` build order, or the user's
   ask), the base path, whether a `spec/ui/design-system/css-variables.json`
   exists to copy in, and whether `spec/contract/openapi.json` exists at the git
   root (→ it generates/refreshes the **typed client** in
   `spec/contract/client/`). It returns a **BUILD BRIEF** (app root, alias
   names, tokens path, isolate command, port base, contract + browser posture) —
   **inline those ≤8 fact lines into every component prompt** so no builder
   re-derives them; facts inline, bulk behind paths. **Then, for any multi-unit
   build (≥3 units): spawn `sprig-build-analyst` ONCE** (before the first wave,
   synchronously) with the app root, breakdown root, the facts block, and the
   unit list — it digests the specs' prop/event APIs, the store/DI seams, and
   the framework gotchas into `spec/misc/build/cheatsheet.md` (≤3KB). Every
   builder brief then carries the CHEATSHEET PATH instead of a references
   reading list — one agent buys the education, N read the digest (measured
   without it: nine page agents each re-read the same four reference docs and
   twelve sibling templates). **The delegation is MANDATORY, and it caps YOUR
   OWN reading: before Wave 1 you open `index.md` and the scaffolder's BUILD
   BRIEF — nothing else.** If you catch yourself opening a unit spec, a
   reference doc, extracted source, or a fixture app "to brief the builders
   accurately", you are doing the analyst's job on the expensive tier: STOP and
   spawn it (measured: an orchestrator spent ~16 serial reading steps building
   the cheatsheet itself and the run hit the wall clock with two units never
   started). A builder-returned gotcha propagates by APPENDING one line to the
   cheatsheet — never by fattening later briefs. Before a page-composition wave,
   optionally re-spawn the analyst to refresh the sheet against as-built props.
   **Cross-island state is wired, never stored.** Islands share state ONLY via
   the `sets:`/`reads:`/`edits:` template verbs (`references/wiring.md`); the
   cheatsheet MUST carry the **channel map** (channel → origin `sets:` → editors
   → readers, shell vs page scope). No `state/*.ts` signal modules, no shared
   store, no nested live parent island, no `ctx.output()` across island
   boundaries — if `index.md` §seams prescribes any of those, the analyst
   translates them into channels before the first wave (measured: a store-module
   seam reached every builder verbatim and only surfaced as a `ctx.output` stub
   once tests ran in a real browser). `sprig map` proves the dataflow; the
   wiring lint in `sprig check` fails the build on an unwired channel.
2. **Build each unit in isolation, in build order.** Walk the breakdown
   `index.md` build order — **tokens → shared components (primitives before
   composites) → page-local components → page compositions** — and for each unit
   delegate to **`sprig-build-component`** with its breakdown spec as **resolved
   ABSOLUTE paths you looked up in `index.md` / the breakdown tree ONCE**: the
   unit's breakdown folder, its `<name>.md`, `isolate/`, `screenshots/`, and the
   target src dir. Never brief a specialist with just a name and "glob for it" —
   a measured fleet did that 652 times and every agent re-searched the tree the
   orchestrator already held. Each unit must be green in `sprig isolate`
   **before** the units that compose it — and start each composition the moment
   ITS OWN direct children are green, never parked behind unrelated stragglers
   (three measured runs died with every leaf green and the page never composed).
   Independent units run in parallel, **capped at 4–6 concurrent, in chunked
   waves — and floored at 4 while ≥4 units are unblocked** (measured: waves of
   1–2 stretched a 7-unit build past its wall clock) — measured on real fleets,
   10+ concurrent builders saturate the org's tokens-per-minute quota, agents
   die on 429/529 and re-execute from scratch (one fleet: 78 units → 329
   executions, one unit built 6× over 16 hours). In a Workflow script:
   `for (const wave of chunks(units, 5)) await parallel(wave.map(…))`; if a wave
   still dies of rate limits, halve the chunk size before resuming — never
   relaunch the full fan-out. **Assign each parallel agent its own PORT** (e.g.
   `4100 + index`) **and its own workbench root**
   (`SPRIG_WB_ROOT=/tmp/wb-<port>`, exported on every `isolate` call) in its
   prompt so isolate servers and workbench regenerations never collide (the
   pkill-a-sibling wars and the shared-workbench preview race are both measured
   failure modes). A re-run of `sprig isolate` on a workbench whose server is
   still up reuses it (prints the URL, exits 0); `kill <pid>` of a run stops
   its whole chain; an unattended workbench exits by itself after 30 min idle
   (`SPRIG_IDLE_EXIT`) — so a fleet never accumulates servers (17 leaked in one
   box was the measured failure mode). Without a breakdown spec, the same specialist authors a
   minimal `isolate/` and runs the same loop. **Long-unit split (the quadratic
   rule).** An agent loop re-sends its whole history every turn — input cost
   grows with the SQUARE of loop length, so one 150-turn
   build-diagnose-fix-verify marathon costs ~4× two 75-turn agents. When a
   builder stops at its iteration budget (or returns `checkpoint`), do NOT tell
   it to keep going: spawn a FRESH `sprig-build-component` whose brief inlines
   the predecessor's exact findings — the red rows verbatim, the files it wrote,
   its root-cause notes — with the instruction "fix exactly these; do not
   re-discover". A fresh agent restarts the meter at ~17K and its early turns
   are its cheapest. **Page compositions are STRUCTURALLY two spawns, always**
   (the measured 250–345-turn monolith class). Two rules learned the hard way
   about briefing them: a "split when stuck" trigger never fires (agents can't
   observe their own turn count), and a "build green but stop after one fix
   pass" caveat loses to the green-seeking goal (measured: spawn-1 ran to 244K
   ctx past its contract). So spawn #1's brief carries a DIFFERENT GOAL, not a
   limited version of the same one: its deliverable IS the checkpoint — "compose
   the template, author the cases, run the suite ONCE, write
   `spec/misc/build/<page>.checkpoint.md`, return. Reds in the checkpoint are
   EXPECTED output, not your failure; fixing them is the next agent's job, and
   fixing them yourself is exceeding your brief." Spawn #2 (only if reds) gets
   the checkpoint inlined and owns green. **Seam safety (how the split cannot
   cost accuracy):**
   - **Validate the checkpoint before spawning.** Required sections: greens;
     reds with exact failing assertions; root-cause notes; files written;
     RULED-OUT list; next step. A checkpoint missing any of these is a wrong
     brief — bounce it back one turn ("complete the checkpoint"), never hand a
     successor a vague seam.
   - **Predecessor greens are pinned.** The successor's definition of done is
     the FULL case set green — its brief says so explicitly; a fix that breaks a
     predecessor's green case is a regression, not progress.
   - **Escalate, don't repeat.** Successor #1 is a FIXER (findings inlined). If
     it checkpoints on the SAME failing assertions, that repetition is the
     ping-pong signal — the bug is deeper than a patch. Successor #2 is then a
     DIAGNOSER: its brief forbids code edits until it states a root-cause
     hypothesis that explains ALL evidence from BOTH checkpoints (it reads them
     plus the diff of prior changes), then it fixes against that hypothesis.
   - **Cap = 3 agents, and a capped-out unit returns RED carrying its checkpoint
     trail** — two diagnoses and a hypothesis history is a well-documented bug
     report for the human, not silent churn.
3. **Verify the whole app.** After units are green: first the whole-suite
   receipt — one `SPRIG_WB_ROOT=/tmp/wb-final isolate test --json` at the app
   root, every case in a single run (units were only ever proven one at a time;
   a composition can break a sibling's case and per-unit verdicts won't show it)
   — then have the scaffolder run the prod-build smoke (`deno task build` →
   `deno task start`, hit a real URL). Deeper QA of the running app — hunting
   bugs, perf, regressions — is the **`sprig:audit`** stage downstream, not this
   skill.

**Fleet hygiene (you own this):** specialists are pinned to `sonnet` in their
agent defs — don't override to `inherit` (an inherited fleet ran hundreds of
mechanical builders on the session's expensive tier). Collect each unit's
≤20-line summary; never paste isolate/test dumps into the session. Run a big
build in a FRESH session and let the workflow return counts + red-unit ids —
long-lived sessions measured at 400–570K tokens of context re-pay that context
on every turn.

**Orchestrator conduct:** after spawning agents, END YOUR TURN and let task
notifications re-invoke you — never `sleep`-poll between stages (measured on a
rune build: 32% of wall time was orchestrator sleeps). **Unattended runs are the
exception** (headless `claude -p`, CI, evals — any brief that says "work fully
autonomously"): there, end-turn-and-wait is FATAL — the CLI terminates the whole
run when background tasks are still running ~600s after your turn ends
(measured: a fleet died mid-wave exactly this way, page never composed). In an
unattended run spawn each wave SYNCHRONOUSLY — all of the wave's Agent calls in
ONE message with `run_in_background: false`, so they run concurrently and your
turn continues when the wave returns — and still never sleep-poll. Verify by
RECEIPT: a builder's isolate verdicts and the scaffolder's smoke result ARE the
state — don't re-run their checks inline or re-walk their file trees; a
mid-build fix re-routes through the owning specialist. For fleets ≤ ~15 units,
track the queue in your plan text — don't burn an API turn per task-ledger
update (measured: 20 bookkeeping turns on a 10-agent build). And never search
the filesystem yourself — every skill reference lives at
`~/.claude/skills/<skill>/references/<file>`; read exact paths (an orchestrator
was measured running `find /` for a reference file whose path it knew).

**Briefing rule (root cause of fleet waste):** a specialist that has to SEARCH
was under-briefed. Before delegating, YOU resolve — absolute, copied verbatim
from `index.md` / stage returns, never retyped by hand — every path the
specialist touches (spec folder, evidence files, target dir), plus its PORT and
any running-server URL. If a specialist returns `blocked: missing path`, the
brief was wrong: fix the brief and re-delegate; never answer "search for it".
**Spec-pending units** (regions with no written spec) get the breakdown's
extracted-source folder path for their region passed EXPLICITLY — without it,
builders hunt the original prototype file across the tree (measured:
`find -name
*prototype*` hunts in an otherwise clean run). Briefs stay lean —
facts inline (≤8 lines), spec content by PATH: a builder brief past ~5KB
(scaffolder ~2.5KB) is inlining prose the specialist should read from disk
(measured: an orchestrator pre-digested each unit's spec into 5–7KB briefs and
blew every prompt budget while the specialists re-read the specs anyway).

## The annotate review loop (the user owns the server)

Once the app runs, feedback is collected **on the real app**, keyed to
components. This loop spans many turns, so **the server is the USER's** — ask
them to run `sprig dev --annotate` in their **own terminal** (they can paste it
here with a leading `!`). It picks a **stable port hashed from the app name**,
prints both URLs (app + annotate, and the isolate workbench), and opens them;
re-running is **idempotent** (it reprints, never duplicates or drifts the port).
**Don't start it as your own background task** — that's what makes "the server
keeps dropping." If it's down, ask the user to restart that one command.

Run each round autonomously off `spec/ui/build-notes.json` (a fixed path — you
don't need the port):

1. **Read** `build-notes.json`. Each entry is keyed to a **component** + its
   `isolateUrl`, and each note line is tagged with the specific element clicked.
   Nothing new? Tell the user the app URL and wait.
2. **Delegate the fix** to **`sprig-build-component`** for the component that
   owns the clicked element — passing the entry (element tag + note +
   `isolateUrl`). It edits only that folder, verifies in the isolate workbench,
   and reports.
3. **Clear** that entry from `build-notes.json` once the specialist confirms it
   green. An `unresolved:<selector>` entry didn't map to a component — locate
   the owner by selector and delegate that.
4. **Report, don't relaunch.** HMR already pushed the edits live. Tell the user
   "applied N — review and ⌘/Ctrl+click the next round," and repeat. Don't
   restart the server.

(`sprig dev --annotate <html>` is the single-prototype variant — that's
`sprig:prototype`. A prototype handed to you may carry inline
`data-note`/`data-note-css` annotations; the component specialist applies them
as behavior/scoped-styles and strips them from output.)

## Decision matrix — route the task

| A page/component/island: data + lifecycle, signals, DI, optimistic write, template, scoped styles, isolate | **`sprig-build-component`**                                                         |
| Apply a `build-notes.json` entry                                                                           | **`sprig-build-component`** (the owning component)                                  |
| Pure conceptual question (no file produced)                                                                | read the matching `references/` leaf yourself (`INDEX.md` is the table of contents) |

## Top gotchas (enforce across specialists)

- **Server writes are optimistic by default** (mandatory): update the UI now,
  call in the background, roll back on failure — never
  spinner-and-`location.reload()`. Spinner-and-wait only when the result is
  unknowable client-side or a `data-note` says so.
- **Data crosses the waist through the generated typed client** when one exists
  (`spec/contract/client/`, generated from the rune OpenAPI):
  `resolve.ts`/services and islands import its DTO types and endpoint wrappers —
  no hand-typed DTO shapes, no bare string routes. Reads are **queries**, writes
  are **commands** (intent verbs) — never an edit-this-record call (the waist
  rule; the sprig repo's `contract.md`).
- **A component is a folder, not a `.tsx`**; **`logic.ts` = island** (static
  folders ship no JS and their `(event)` bindings never fire).
- **`inject()` synchronously**, serializable island props/state only,
  **`static key`** on a `StateService`, **design tokens variables-only** in
  `ui/src/css-variables.json`.
- **Run it in a browser and run the production build** before declaring done —
  `sprig dev` passing ≠ production working.
- **`sprig` feels stale after an update?** `sprig update` re-resolves to latest.
