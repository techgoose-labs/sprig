# Routing & data loading

Routes are an explicit table, not filesystem magic. Each route's `load` names a
**page folder** under `src`; the framework renders that folder's `template.html`
and auto-loads its data.

```ts
// src/main.ts
import { bootstrap, defineRoutes } from "@mrg-keystone/sprig";
import { createRenderer } from "@mrg-keystone/sprig/bedrock";
import { dirname, fromFileUrl } from "@std/path";

export const routes = defineRoutes([
  { path: "", load: "pages/home" }, // /ui
  { path: "users/:id", load: "pages/user" }, // /ui/users/:id
]);

export const renderer = await createRenderer(
  dirname(fromFileUrl(import.meta.url)),
  "/ui",
  {
    dev: !!Deno.env.get("SPRIG_DEV"),
  },
);
export const app = bootstrap({ routes, base: "/ui", renderer });
```

- `path` is relative to the app `base` (`"/ui"` here). `:param` segments are
  dynamic.
- `load` is the page folder path (relative to `src`): `"pages/home"`. Its
  basename is the page selector; its `template.html` is the view.
- **`bootstrap({ routes, base, renderer })` is the only wiring.** The `renderer`
  (from `createRenderer`) provides rendering AND auto-loads each page's data —
  there is **no `modules: {}` map and no per-page import**.

## Loading a page's data

Two ways, both auto-discovered by the route's `load` — you don't register
either:

1. **The page's `logic.ts` class** (preferred). `onServerInit` runs on the
   server before render; set fields and the template binds to them. It's also
   the page's client behavior (the page hydrates as a root island). See
   `references/component-model.md`.

   ```ts
   // pages/user/logic.ts
   import { Backend, inject } from "@mrg-keystone/sprig";
   export default class User {
     user: { name: string } | null = null;
     async onServerInit() {
       // route params + the in-process Backend are available here
       this.user = await inject(Backend).fetch("/users/123").then((r) =>
         r.json()
       );
     }
   }
   ```

2. **A `resolve.ts`** — a function returning the page's data (a lighter
   alternative when the page needs no client behavior):

   ```ts
   // pages/home/resolve.ts
   import type { Resolve } from "@mrg-keystone/sprig";
   export const resolve: Resolve = ({ params, url }) => ({ name: "sprig" });
   ```

   **The full `ResolveCtx` contract** (this is everything — never excavate the
   framework source or the Deno cache for more; a measured fleet burned 112 tool
   calls doing that):
   - `ctx.params: Record<string, string>` — the matched route params (`:id` →
     `params.id`).
   - `ctx.url: URL` — the request URL; query via `url.searchParams`.
   - **Deliberately NO `headers` and NO `session`.** Cookies/session are
     unreadable inside `resolve` — that's the documented SSR-data-leak guard.
     Auth checks belong in guards / per-route `grants`; a page whose DATA needs
     the session profile uses `logic.ts onServerLoad(ctx: RouteCtx)` instead,
     where `RouteCtx = { url, params, session: SessionProfile | null }` — the
     resolve twin widened with the session.
   - **Return** `Record<string, unknown>` (sync or a Promise). The returned
     object becomes the template's inputs, exactly like `logic.ts` fields;
     values crossing into an island must be serializable.
   - **DI:** `resolve` runs inside the request's route injector (shared with the
     guard chain) — `inject(Backend)` etc. work, but only SYNCHRONOUSLY (before
     any `await`), the same rule as components.
   - **Errors:** a throwing `resolve` → controlled **500** (fails closed). A
     matched route whose RESOURCE is missing is not a throw: capture the
     injector synchronously and set the status —
     ```ts
     import { currentInjector, setResponseStatus } from "@mrg-keystone/sprig";
     export const resolve: Resolve = async ({ params }) => {
       const inj = currentInjector(); // capture BEFORE any await
       const org = await inject(Backend).fetch(`/orgs/${params.id}`).then((r) =>
         r.ok ? r.json() : null
       );
       if (!org) setResponseStatus(inj, 404); // SSR response line carries the 404
       return { org };
     };
     ```

A page folder with neither just renders its `template.html` statically.

## Guards

A guard returns **the route the navigation should go to** as path segments:
return `ctx.path` (the target route) to proceed, any other route to answer with
a **302** there (on-base bare path). Attach via `guards: [...]` on a route — a
parent's guards protect its whole subtree (chain runs parent-first, before
`resolve`, so a denied page does no data work).

```ts
import { type Guard, inject } from "@mrg-keystone/sprig";

const requireAuth: Guard = (ctx) => {
  if (!inject(Session).user) return ["login"]; // → 302 /login
  return ctx.path; // same route → proceed
};

export const routes = defineRoutes([
  { path: "login", load: "pages/login" },
  {
    path: "admin",
    load: "pages/admin",
    guards: [requireAuth], // + all children
    children: [{ path: "users", load: "pages/users" }],
  },
]);
```

- `ctx = { path, params, url, headers }` (headers = the request’s — cookies live
  there, the basis for a login guard); async guards fine; call `inject()`
  synchronously (before any `await`) — guards share the request's route injector
  with `resolve`.
- Returned segments normalize (`["admin/users"]` ≡ `["admin","users"]`; `[]` =
  root). First divergent guard wins; a throwing guard → controlled 500 (fails
  closed).
- Returned routes are APP-RELATIVE (`["login"]`, never `["ui","login"]`) — the
  framework prefixes `base` onto the redirect Location.
- Client soft-nav falls back to a full navigation on redirects — no client
  wiring needed.
- Complete runnable example: `fixtures/guarded-app` in the sprig repo (login
  flow, subtree inheritance, async admin check, guard-only "action" routes).

## The render output

`createRenderer(srcRoot, base, opts)` scans `srcRoot` for every folder-component
(registers them by selector), reads the prebuilt template registry
(`static/templates.json`, produced by `sprig build` — so the production runtime
never loads tree-sitter), and renders a matched page into the shell's
`<router-outlet>`. `bootstrap` returns a `SprigApp` with a
`fetch(req, info, env?)` handler.
