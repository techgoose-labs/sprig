# Templates — Angular-flavored HTML

A `template.html` is HTML with Angular-style bindings, evaluated against the
component's `logic.ts` scope (the class instance, or the object `setup()`
returns). No JSX, no Preact. Bindings are parsed at build time (tree-sitter) and
rendered to HTML on the server; `(event)` bindings wire up at hydration (so they
need a `logic.ts`).

## Interpolation

```html
<h1>Hello, {{ name }}</h1>
<p>{{ count() }} item(s)</p>            <!-- call a signal/method to read it -->
<span>{{ ok ? "✓" : "✗" }}</span>      <!-- expressions, ternaries, member access -->
```

Interpolated text is **HTML-escaped**. To inject trusted HTML use `[innerHTML]`.

## Property / input bindings — `[prop]="expr"`

One-way bind a DOM property or a child component's input:

```html
<button [disabled]="busy()">Save</button>
<input [value]="query" />
<article [innerHTML]="renderedMarkdown"></article>
<!-- trusted: not escaped -->
<count-display [value]="count()"></count-display>
<!-- input into a child component -->
```

## Event bindings — `(event)="handler()"`

Bind a DOM event to a scope method. Runs **only after hydration**, so the
component needs a `logic.ts`:

```html
<button (click)="inc()">+1</button>
<form (submit)="save()">…</form>
```

## Control flow blocks

```html
@if (user()) {
  <p>Hi {{ user().name }}</p>
} @else {
  <a href="/ui/login">Sign in</a>
}

@for (item of items; track item.id) {
  <li>{{ item.title }}</li>
} @empty {
  <li>Nothing yet.</li>
}
```

`@for` needs a `track` expression (a stable key). `@empty` renders when the list
is empty.

## Composing components

Render another folder-component by its **selector** (the folder basename),
passing inputs with `[in]` and listening with `(ev)`:

```html
<ui-button id="increment" content="+1" (click)="inc()"></ui-button>
<badge></badge>
```

A child folder named `components/ui-button/` is `<ui-button>`. If it has a
`logic.ts` it hydrates as its own island; if static it renders inline with zero
JS.

## Projection — `<content>`

A component projects its children into its own template where it places
`<content>` (which may self-close as `<content/>`). `<ng-content>` is accepted
as an alias.

```html
<!-- components/card/template.html -->
<section class="card">
  <content />
</section>
```

```html
<!-- usage -->
<card>
  <p>projected into the card</p>
</card>
```

Scope a slot with `select="tag" / ".class" / "[attr]"`; the unmatched remainder
fills the default `<content/>`. A slot's own children are the fallback shown
when nothing is projected: `<content>default label</content>`.

## Expression language limits (a sandboxed subset, not JavaScript)

Template expressions (`{{ }}`, `[prop]`, `@if`/`@let`…) evaluate in a sandbox
against the component scope — three traps measured on real fleets (agents
reverse-engineered the compiler to learn these; don't):

- **`|` is the PIPE operator** (Angular-style: `{{ 0.575 | percent }}`), so
  bitwise OR can never work — `expr | 0` is parsed as a pipe, not a floor.
  Floor/round without `Math`: integer arithmetic (`(n - (n % 60)) / 60`) or
  compute in `logic.ts`.
- **Host globals (`Math`, `Date`, `JSON`…) are not in scope** — expressions see
  the component's fields/`@let` locals only. Derive anything non-trivial in
  `logic.ts` (islands) or via `@let` arithmetic (static templates).
- **`@let` is ONE physical line** — a multi-line `@let` doesn't parse. Split
  long derivations into several `@let`s.

Static (no-`logic.ts`) components render **inlined server-side** — no
`<my-component>` wrapper element survives into the served HTML. Tests and parent
styles must target the rendered inner DOM (e.g. `.avatar img`), never the
component-tag selector.

## The shell + `<router-outlet>`

`src/shell/template.html` is the document layout; the matched page renders where
you place `<router-outlet>`:

```html
<div class="app-root">
  <router-outlet></router-outlet>
</div>
```

## Styles

A folder's `styles.css` is **component-scoped** by the build (a path-derived
marker), so selectors can't leak between components. App-wide styles (tokens,
resets, fonts) go in the shell.
