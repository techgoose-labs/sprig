# Contract: prototype

> **Producer:** prototype · **Consumers:** breakdown (the build spec) +
> `rune:spec` (ratifies the seams — bridge 1 of
> [`contract.md`](../../../contract.md)) · Pipeline: design → prototype →
> breakdown → build → audit

ONE self-contained, throwaway **two-seam prototype folder** that shows the
complete look-and-feel and main flow — and carries the draft backend contract
**pre-extracted**. The thing `breakdown` decomposes into a build spec, and
`rune:spec` seeds from.

## Artifact

A folder **`spec/ui/<app>-prototype/`** (the shared UI-pipeline home at the git
root):

- `_test-prototype.html` — presentation ONLY (fixed name; the host serves it).
  CDN scripts, no build step, holds no data.
- `objects/<type>.json` — **seam 1, the read model**: one file per object type;
  the file is that type's collection (an array of id-related records, joined
  client-side).
- `commands.json` — **seam 2, the write contract**: intent verbs
  `{ type, kind, input, does }` with `kind ∈ create|set|append|adjust|remove` —
  never an editable record.
- `_start.ts` + `deno.json` — the **generic host, copied verbatim**
  (`deno task start` → `http://localhost:8723`, `PORT` overrides). Injects
  `window.objects`/`window.commands` + the annotate overlay at serve time;
  introspects the contract over HTTP (`GET /objects`, `GET /commands`,
  `GET /events`); appends every applied command to `events.json`.
- `feedback/` — the annotate sink (`feedback.json`).

**Legacy shape** (pre-contract): a single self-contained
`spec/ui/<app>-prototype.html` with hardcoded data — still valid breakdown
input; new prototypes use the folder.

## Shape (what consumers can rely on)

- **Renderable with Playwright** — start the host (`deno task start` in the
  folder), navigate `http://localhost:8723/`; breakdown walks the DOM, extracts
  tokens, captures screenshots/filmstrips. A host restart is a clean reset (seed
  files stay pristine), so captures reproduce.
- The **design-system brand applied** — daisyUI semantic classes + `data-theme`,
  via the CDN stack (daisyUI + `@tailwindcss/browser@4` + lucide).
- **Every screen of the flow is present**, including the unglamorous states
  (empty, loading, error/toast, overflow). Multiple "pages" are expressed via
  client-side routing, so breakdown counts **views, not files**.
- **The seams ARE the draft contract** (bridge 1): each `objects/<type>.json`
  maps to a backend type + read DTO + query endpoints (`<type>.all`,
  `<type>.get`); each `commands.json` entry maps to a command verb + input DTO,
  its `kind` seeding `rune:data`'s immutability strategy. Introspectable over
  HTTP without opening a file.

## Invariants

- **Location:** `spec/ui/<app>-prototype/` (glob `spec/ui/*-prototype/`; legacy
  glob `spec/ui/*-prototype.html`).
- The UI holds no data and makes no `fetch` beyond the two injected seams;
  writes are intent verbs, **never an "edit-this-record"** (the waist rule).
- The host is generic and never edited per-app; seed data is deterministic
  (screenshots reproduce).
- It is **throwaway** — reference ground truth for the spec, never deliverable
  code. The seams' _content_ is the one part that survives: `rune:spec` ratifies
  it into the canonical contract.

## Validation

`deno task start` serves it; every flow + unglamorous state is reachable by
clicking; `GET /objects` and `GET /commands` return the two seams.
