# interfaces/ — the contracts between pipeline stages

These files are the **only thing skills reference across their boundaries.**
Each stage reads its input contract and writes its output contract; **no skill
names another skill, and no skill reaches into another skill's files.** That
decoupling is the point: rename, reorder, or swap a stage and the contracts
don't move.

## The pipeline

```
design ──► prototype ──► breakdown ──► build ──► audit
```

Strictly **linear** — each stage consumes **only** its immediate predecessor's
output.

| Contract                            | Producer  | Consumer  | The artifact                                                                                |
| ----------------------------------- | --------- | --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [`design-system`](design-system.md) | design    | prototype | `spec/ui/design-system/` — a brand-themed design-system folder                              |
| [`prototype`](prototype.md)         | prototype | breakdown | `spec/ui/<app>-prototype/` — the two-seam prototype folder (legacy: one `*-prototype.html`) |
| [`ui-breakdown`](ui-breakdown.md)   | breakdown | build     | `spec/ui/breakdown/` — the build spec                                                       |
| [`sprig-app`](sprig-app.md)         | build     | audit     | a running sprig app                                                                         |

The first three artifacts share one home — **`spec/ui/`** at the **git root**
(the dir containing `.git`; falls back to the project dir outside a git repo) —
so each stage finds its input at a known path (`design-system/`,
`<app>-prototype/`, `breakdown/`). The `build` stage reads `spec/ui/breakdown/`
and emits the app; `audit` exercises the running app.

**The cross-boundary contract** is the one first-class artifact that isn't
stage-to-stage: the **waist** of the frontend/backend diamond — **queries +
commands, never an editable record** — declared in `contract.md` at the sprig
repo root (sibling to `coms.md` / `coordinate.md`). The prototype's two seams
(`objects/` + `commands.json`) **seed** it (bridge 1); the rune pipeline
**ratifies** it and generates `spec/contract/` at the git root (OpenAPI + typed
client); breakdown **binds** against it and build **imports** its client (bridge
2). A change to it is breaking for **both repos** — update producer, consumer,
and `contract.md` together.

## Rules

- **Contracts are named by the artifact, not the skill.** They reference
  pipeline **roles** (design / prototype / breakdown / build / audit), never a
  skill's directory name — so renaming a skill (`sprig:build`,
  `sprig:breakdown`, `sprig:audit`) touches dir names and frontmatter, **not**
  these contracts.
- **A skill references a contract by one stable relative path:**
  `../interfaces/<artifact>.md`. `interfaces/` is a sibling of every skill
  directory in **both** layouts — the dev checkout (`skills/<skill>/` ↔
  `skills/interfaces/`) and the flat install (`~/.claude/skills/sprig:<skill>/`
  ↔ `~/.claude/skills/interfaces/`) — so the one path resolves either way.
- **Each skill's SKILL.md states only its edges:** "consumes `<X>`, produces
  `<Y>`," plus one thin "next stage" pointer. Everything about the artifact's
  _format_ lives in the contract.
- A contract change is a **breaking change for both** its producer and its
  consumer — update both sides together.

## Install

The bundle installer copies this directory to `~/.claude/skills/interfaces/`,
and the skills install flat as `~/.claude/skills/sprig:<name>`, so the
`../interfaces/` path resolves after install exactly as in the dev checkout. The
umbrella is a **`sprig:` name prefix** (a `plugin:skill` namespace), not a
subdirectory: Claude Code only discovers skills that are **direct children** of
`~/.claude/skills/`, so a nested `~/.claude/skills/sprig/<name>` would never
load.
