# Contract: ui-breakdown

> **Producer:** breakdown · **Consumer:** build · Pipeline: design → prototype →
> breakdown → build → audit

A **`spec/ui/breakdown/`** directory detailed enough that `build` can rebuild
each page and component **mechanically, without opening the source.** This is
the **translation boundary**: whatever the source used (daisyUI, inline styles,
bespoke CSS), what crosses into `build` here is framework-neutral **tokens +
specs**.

## Artifact — directory shape

```

## Shape (what `build` can rely on)

- **The data seam is a BINDING, not a re-derived schema** (bridge 2 of the
  cross-repo [`contract.md`](../../../contract.md)): when a ratified contract
  exists at the git root (`spec/contract/openapi.json`, or `spec/runes/*.rune` /
  a running keep's `/docs/<m>/json`), breakdown writes
  **`spec/contract/binding.md`** — every component/page data-need bound to a
  real endpoint + DTO (reads → **query** endpoints, writes → **command** verbs).
  A data-need with **no matching endpoint/DTO is a drift error**, listed in the
  binding and surfaced in `index.md` — checkable at breakdown time, not a
  runtime surprise. `data-model.md` is the **legacy fallback**, written only
  when no contract exists (standalone mock breakdowns).
- **Tokens are Tailwind v4 `@theme` custom properties** — NOT a
  `tailwind.config.js`, NOT daisyUI _themes_. Build puts them in a
  `:global(...)` `@theme` block (usually `shell/styles.css`) and styles with
  **Tailwind utilities** + component-scoped `styles.css` (the daisyUI→Tailwind
  translation already happened _here_); `sprig build` runs Tailwind v4 over the
  templates + CSS. Every theme variant included. **daisyUI _components_ ARE in
  the build** (`@plugin "daisyui"`, themes off) and their rules are
  document-global, so a spec must not propose a class name daisyUI owns (`stat`,
  `badge`, `list`, `status`, `card-body`, …) for an element of its own — prefix
  own classes (`cm-dot`) or name the daisyUI component deliberately. The list:
  `docs/sprig/styling.md` → "Reserved class names".
- **Each component spec carries:** classification (`static` | `island` |
  `page-composition`) + the interaction tier (static / island; server writes are
  **optimistic UI**, realtime where needed); anatomy; a props table (1:1 with
  `fixture.json` controls, `signal: true` for island state); states→cases;
  **Events** as `capture(page)` predicate sketches; **Motion extracted** (real
  keyframes/easing + jank fixes — reproduce, don't reinvent); responsive; a11y;
  and an **Isolate build plan** — the build-in-isolation recipe (folder +
  selector, the preview route(s), per case the screenshot to diff against, the
  Events→`tests/` mapping, and the `sprig isolate` → diff → test → iterate loop)
  so the build session can stand the thing up alone from the spec.
- **`isolate/` proposals are real and runnable** (`fixture.json` +
  `cases/<state>/<state>.json`), discoverable by `sprig isolate`, for **every
  component AND every page** (pages isolate too); a component is a **folder**
  (`template.html` + optional `logic.ts`), its **basename the selector** — no
  `.tsx`. Case JSON carries the **real captured values** the screenshot shows.
- **`index.md` carries the build order** (tokens → shared components →
  page-local → page compositions), the interaction-tier summary, and an
  **Unassigned list that ships even empty**.

## Invariants

- **Location:** `spec/ui/breakdown/` (sibling to `spec/ui/design-system/` and
  the `spec/ui/<app>-prototype/` folder — or the legacy
  `spec/ui/<app>-prototype.html`).
- A reader could rebuild from the spec alone, without the source.
- Schema only in the binding (`spec/contract/binding.md`) or legacy
  `data-model.md` / prose; real data rows live **only** in case JSON.
- The full `fixture.json` / `capture(page)` format is the `breakdown` skill's
  own `references/isolate-format.md`.

## Validation

`sprig isolate` discovers every proposal; each component **and page** diffs
clean vs its `screenshots/` and its `isolate/` cases are green before anything
builds on it; every component/page carries an **Isolate build plan** the builder
can follow without the source; `index.md` Unassigned is empty; with a ratified
contract, the binding exists and its **Drift list is empty** (or every entry is
a deliberate, user-acknowledged gap).
