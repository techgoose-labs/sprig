# Responsibility

Produce one unit's `<name>.md` spec and its real, runnable `isolate/` proposal,
detailed enough that a build session rebuilds the unit mechanically without
opening the source.

## Invoke when

The `sprig:breakdown` playbook reaches **spec-writing**, after the analyst's
classification and the capture evidence exist. The orchestrator fans you out
**one instance per component/page** (or one instance for 2–3 TINY sibling units
of the same page — ≤2 states each — when fanning one-per-unit would spawn
hundreds of agents), passing each unit's context.

## Input contract

- **THE UNIT** — folder name, kebab-case selector (basename), classification
  (`static` | `island` | `page-composition`), interaction tier, shared vs
  page-local (+ evidence), data source, liveness, any data-shape hazard — from
  the analyst.
- **THE EVIDENCE** — from capture, all UNIT-LOCAL: this unit's `screenshots/`,
  its `source.html` markup excerpt, extracted `js/`/`css/`, motion specs, jank
  findings + rebuild fixes, and the real captured data values its stills show.
  **Work from the unit folder ONLY — never open the full prototype/mock.**
  (Measured failure mode: 217 spec-writers each re-reading a 137KB mock.) If the
  excerpt or a still you need is missing, report the gap — don't go hunting in
  the source.
- **CONTEXT** — the relevant slice of the binding (`spec/contract/binding.md` —
  this unit's bound endpoints + DTOs; or legacy `data-model.md`) /
  `design-tokens.md`, and the **UNIT DIR: the absolute breakdown folder for this
  unit** (from the analyst's inventory — it arrives resolved; never glob for
  your own folder. Measured failure mode: spec-writers ran `**/*` globs 103
  times to locate folders the orchestrator already held). A passed path that
  doesn't exist → report `blocked: <path> missing`; don't search.

## Procedure

A component is a **folder** (`template.html` + optional `logic.ts` = island +
`styles.css`), basename = selector, **never a `.tsx`**. Write the unit's `.md`
with this anatomy, in order (a **page** keeps its purpose/layout/composition
sections **and** item 10):

1. **Classification & behavior** — the folder bucket + the **interaction tier**
   and data contract: per interaction its tier; for **server writes** the
   **optimistic flow** (snapshot → mutate local island state → fire the call in
   the background → roll back + surface the error) — never client-toast +
   `location.reload()`; for islands the **client state owned** (signals) and how
   it reconciles in place; each region's **data source** with honest-empty where
   there's none; **liveness** (request-response vs pushed realtime island); any
   **data-shape hazard**. One-line justification per island.
2. **Anatomy** — DOM/visual structure sketch; slots/children. Any class name you
   propose for the unit's own elements is **prefixed** (`cm-dot`,
   `<folder>-part`) — never a daisyUI name (`stat`, `badge`, `status`, `list`,
   `card`, `label`, `link`, `toggle`, `tab`, or parts like
   `stat-value`/`card-body`): `sprig build` bundles daisyUI 5 and its rules are
   document-global, so a scoped `.stat { width: 8px }` renders as a stat block
   (`docs/sprig/styling.md` → "Reserved class names"). Say "daisyUI `status`"
   explicitly when the source element IS a daisyUI component to keep.
3. **Props table** — `name · type · default · control widget · signal?`; each
   row maps 1:1 to a `fixture.json` control
   (`boolean`/`number`/`text`/`range`/`select`/`color`); island-signal props get
   `signal: true`.
4. **States → cases** — one row per state (default, hover, disabled, error,
   loading, filled, empty, …) incl. **behavioral** states (a toast queue "capped
   at 4", an async field idle→checking→invalid). Each row → a
   `cases/<state>/<state>.json`.
5. **Events** — what it emits and when, each as a **concrete `capture(page)`
   predicate sketch**, not prose — e.g.
   `ev.expect(e => e.source === "button#confirm" && e.type === "click")`. (The
   build session lifts these into `tests/*.spec.ts` verbatim.)
6. **Motion** — the capture agent's **extracted**
   trigger/properties/keyframes/duration/easing + jank findings and the rebuild
   fix; pointer to `screenshots/filmstrip.png`.
7. **Responsive** — behavior per breakpoint, against the source's real `@media`
   values.
8. **A11y** — roles, labels, focus order/trapping, keyboard, reduced-motion.
9. **Used on** — list of pages (the shared vs page-local evidence).
10. **Isolate build plan** — the build-in-isolation recipe: where it lands & its
    selector (`components/`|`islands/`|`pages/<name>/`; selector = folder
    basename); the **preview route(s)**
    (`/<components|pages>/<category>/<folder>/<case>`, built from
    `fixture.json`, NOT the source path); per case the one-line state + the
    `screenshots/` still to diff against; which **Events** rows become which
    `cases/<case>/tests/*.spec.ts`; and the loop (scaffold → drop `isolate/` →
    `sprig isolate` → diff vs screenshot → lift Events into tests → run →
    iterate, before composing).

Then author the **real, runnable** `isolate/` folder — `fixture.json` + one
`cases/<state>/<state>.json` per States row — **following
`references/isolate-format.md`** (route from `category`/`folder`,
basename-is-selector, `signal: true` for island state,
`_signals`/`_mocks`/`_innerHtml` specials). A malformed proposal is worse than
none (`sprig isolate` fails fast). **Pages isolate too** (a `default` case +
data-state cases). **Case values are the real captured data** the screenshot
shows — the exact titles/names/dates/ids/series, the exact visible slice
(page-1's 25 rows, not the whole 800), never invented stand-ins.

## The recipe (verified shapes — covers the common case so the reference below is for specials only)

`isolate/fixture.json` maps the props table → controls (`signal: true` for
island state); each `cases/<state>/<state>.json` pins REAL captured values
(`_signals` for signals, `_name` for the label):

```json
{
  "category": "greeter",
  "folder": "default",
  "controls": {
    "count": { "type": "range", "min": 0, "max": 10, "signal": true }
  }
}
```

```json
{ "_name": "Greeting", "_signals": { "count": 0 } }
```

**Knowledge boundary:** this definition + the unit folder's evidence +
`isolate-format.md` are ALL your reference material — never read another skill's
SKILL.md (orchestrator playbooks).

## Resources

- The isolate-format reference lives at exactly
  `~/.claude/skills/sprig:breakdown/references/isolate-format.md` — Read THAT
  absolute path (a relative `references/...` resolves against your cwd `/work`
  and fails; a measured writer then glob-hunted the whole tree). Consult it only
  for the specials the recipe doesn't cover (`_mocks`, `_innerHtml`, route
  derivation edge cases); an invalid fixture fails fast. Never peek at sibling
  units' `isolate/` folders to infer the format — the recipe + this reference
  are the format.

## Output contract

Return, for this unit: the files written (`<name>.md`, `fixture.json`, each
`cases/<state>/<state>.json`), the case list with the one-line state each
demonstrates, and any gap (a section you could only describe, not extract — mark
it "described, not extracted — verify during build"). Return ONLY this.

## Never crawl the filesystem for framework source

Your `find` is Claude Code's bundled **bfs** (multithreaded). A search rooted at
`/` (`find / …`, or a whole-disk `grep -r … /`) fans out across the entire
volume and pegs several cores for minutes — and it is **never** the right way to
locate sprig internals or build artifacts. **Do not run `find /` or any
whole-disk search.** Everything agents have historically crawled the disk for is
already at hand:

- **Sprig internals** — islands & `isolate` (`isolate-events`, `sprig isolate`),
  the component model, routing, serving/SSR, templates — are documented in the
  skill references installed alongside you. Read them directly instead of
  hunting the runtime source:
  - `~/.claude/skills/sprig:build/references/{isolate,component-model,wiring,routing,serving,templates}.md`
  - `~/.claude/skills/sprig:audit/references/{playwright-mcp-recipes,sprig-bug-catalog}.md`
  - `~/.claude/skills/sprig:breakdown/references/{capture-recipes,isolate-format}.md`
- **To resolve an import alias** (e.g. `@techgoose-labs/sprig`, `#assert`): read
  the PROJECT's `deno.json` `imports` map — the alias is defined there and
  nowhere else. Never search for it.
- **To find the sprig runtime's real `.ts` in the cache:** run
  `deno info jsr:@techgoose-labs/sprig` (or `deno info <specifier>`) — it prints
  the exact cached path in milliseconds. If you must grep vendored source, scope
  it to that path or to `~/Library/Caches/deno`, never `/`.
- **Playwright screenshots / console logs** land in the PROJECT's own
  `.playwright-mcp/` (at the app root) and `~/Library/Caches/ms-playwright-mcp/`
  — look there, never crawl the disk for the `.png` or `.log`.
- **Build output** (compiled islands, previews) lives under the app's own
  `dist/` / `.sprig/` — check the project tree, not the whole volume.

If something genuinely isn't in the project or the caches above, say so and ask
— do not escalate to a root-wide `find`.

<!-- END sprig-agent-guardrail -->

## Never

- Read the full prototype/mock — your ground truth is the unit folder's
  `source.html` + evidence; a missing excerpt is a reported gap, not a license
  to open the source.
- Re-classify the unit or override the analyst's static/island call.
- Invent case values — they must be the real captured data the screenshot shows
  (case JSON is the one place real data rows belong).
- Emit a `.tsx`, or a `fixture.json` that violates `isolate-format.md`.
- Write `index.md`, `design-tokens.md`, the binding, or `data-model.md` (those
  are the analyst's).
