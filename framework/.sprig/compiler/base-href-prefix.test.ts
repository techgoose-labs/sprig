// relative nav hrefs (href="/runs"); when mounted under a non-root base (e.g.
// "/ui"), those must land ON the base so a click hits the served route instead
// of 404ing off-base — the same prefixing buildNav() does for the generated nav.
// Off-base surfaces (the other units' namespaces /api + /auth) and
// non-root-relative values (//, https:, #) are left untouched; at base "" it is a
// no-op so the root-mounted composition is byte-identical.
