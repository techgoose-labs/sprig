// TEMPLATE WIRING — the client-side channel runtime (template-wiring-spec.md §3).
//
// The three directional verbs (`sets:` / `reads:` / `edits:`) are collected at
// compile time by render.ts (they never reach the DOM as literal attributes) and
// arrive here through the island props bridge (`__wiring`) or, for router-outlet
// forwarding, through the `data-wire`/`data-wire-owner` attributes stamped on the
// emitted <sprig-outlet>. At hydration, hydrate.ts calls tetherIsland/forwardTethers
// BEFORE the island's first effect render, so the first client paint already reads
// the channel.
//
// Semantics implemented here (each an accepted [DECIDE] default of the spec):
//  • CHANNEL SCOPE is per-template with explicit forwarding: a channel is keyed by
//    (declaring template's scope stamp, channel name) inside a REGION — the nearest
//    enclosing <sprig-outlet>'s content, or the document root. Same-named wiring in
//    two different templates never collides (different owner stamps), and a channel
//    declared inside an outlet's content dies when soft-nav swaps that content
//    (teardownWiringInside), while shell-declared channels survive navigation.
//  • FORWARDING is the framework marker `router-outlet` only: its tether forwards to
//    the mounted PAGE's signal matching the attribute's LOCAL name (longhand renames
//    only the channel side). Islands nested INSIDE the page are not forwarded.
//  • RETENTION: a channel outlives any participant — it holds its last written value
//    in its region until that region is torn down.
//  • SEEDING: a channel is created unseeded (undefined). The first `sets:` tether to
//    hydrate seeds it from its own current value UNLESS the channel already holds an
//    explicitly WRITTEN value (a `.set()`/`.value=`/`.update()` through a tether —
//    mere tethering, which adopts the pre-seed `undefined`, does not count). Every
//    other tether — reads:, edits:, and any non-first sets: — adopts the channel's
//    current value; its own initial value is discarded.
//  • ENFORCED DIRECTION: `.set()` through a reads: tether THROWS in dev AND
//    production; only the message detail is dev-specific (component + channel +
//    template line). Write-narrowing beyond that is not checked at runtime (the
//    origin's declared TYPE does not exist at runtime — documented limitation).
//  • TETHERING REPLACES: the channel's accessor (write-guarded for reads:) is
//    assigned onto the component's declared field; constructor-time closures over
//    the pre-tether signal keep observing the stale one (documented).
