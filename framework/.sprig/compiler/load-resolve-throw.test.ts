// BUG R: loadResolve (mod.ts) wrapped the dynamic import() of resolve.ts in a bare
// try/catch that mapped EVERY error to undefined ("no resolve.ts → static page"). So a
// resolve.ts that EXISTS but throws at import time (syntax/init error) was silently
// treated as "no loader", hiding the real fault — violating the documented meaning of
// undefined ("the page has none"). The fix: stat the file first; a genuinely missing
// resolve.ts → undefined, but an existing one that throws must PROPAGATE.
