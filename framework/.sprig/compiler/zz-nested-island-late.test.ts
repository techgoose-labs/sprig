// ISOLATE BUG 1 — a DATA-DRIVEN nested island (one that first appears in a parent island's
// CLIENT re-render, never in the SSR HTML) stayed permanently inert.
//
// Two composing causes, each fixed + tested here:
//  (1) RENDER-SIDE: componentsForPage only consulted the LOADED-island registry, so a child
//      island whose chunk never loaded (it wasn't in the SSR HTML → never armed → never
//      imported) resolved to undefined → fell through to NATIVE rendering → a bare, empty
//      custom element (measured in the field: 54 bare <chip-editor>, 0 island hosts).
//      FIX: the eager loader registers EVERY island selector (registerIslandSelectors), and
//      componentsForPage resolves a known-but-unloaded island to a shell-emitting island def.
//      The shell now also CARRIES the parent-computed inputs as its props bridge — a child
//      with a live host has the shell discarded by the morph (live host wins, state kept),
//      but a genuinely-new child hydrates from these props.
//  (2) HYDRATE-SIDE: islands were scanned exactly once, at bootstrap. A shell appended by a
//      later morph was never armed, so its chunk never loaded. FIX: rescanIslands() after
//      each island effect render arms not-yet-armed hosts (idempotent — armed/hydrated
//      hosts are skipped by scheduleLoad).
