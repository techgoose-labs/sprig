// withServerInjector — the island/page server-DI wrap. The regression pinned
// here: a page's onServerInit must resolve REQUEST-scoped tokens (the
// per-request `Backend` binding) — the component injector is parented to the
// request's injector when one is passed. An orphaned fresh root (the old
// behavior) made `inject(Backend)` throw "not bound" in every page class while
// resolve.ts worked — the first real composed app hit it in production.
