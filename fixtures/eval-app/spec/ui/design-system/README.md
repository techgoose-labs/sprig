# Hearth Design System

> **Note on naming:** the daisyUI theme is named `brand`/`brand-dark` (generic)
> so the artifact stays a reusable template; the brand identity lives in the
> token _values_ and in this doc.

**Hearth** is a community guestbook — a little warm corner of the internet where
visitors leave a message on the wall. The system feels inviting, cozy, and a
touch hand-made: cream paper, espresso ink, a terracotta welcome, and headings
in a friendly handwriting.

Built to be **consumed by the `prototype` skill** with zero translation. Single
source of truth: **`theme.css`** (Tailwind 4 + daisyUI 5).

### Quick links

- **See it:** `preview/showcase.html`
- **Apply in a prototype:** `consume/prototype.md`

## Brand voice

- **Register:** warm, first-person, conversational — like a host welcoming you
  in. Never corporate.
- **Casing:** sentence case in UI; the wordmark and short warm phrases may use
  the handwriting display.
- **Pace:** short, kind sentences. Invite, don't instruct ("Leave a warm note…",
  not "Submit input").
- **Emoji:** sparing — a single celebratory beat (a posted message) is plenty.
- **Dates / numbers:** relative and human ("2 hours ago", "12 others signed
  today").

## Visual foundations (the 4 pillars)

1. **Typography** — Caveat (display, a handwriting script, set at weight 700) +
   Quicksand (body, a clean geometric rounded sans). Major-third (1.25) modular
   scale; display tracking `-0.015em`. Caveat is headings/wordmark only — it is
   not a body face.
2. **Motion** — `--ease-bounce` `cubic-bezier(0.34, 1.56, 0.64, 1)` (a warm
   overshoot) + `--ease-standard` `cubic-bezier(0.20, 0, 0, 1)`; durations 120 /
   200 / 320ms. Nothing over 400ms.
3. **Depth & atmosphere** — daisyUI `--depth: 1` (a soft, cozy shadow) +
   `--noise: 1` (subtle grain), with a generous `--radius-box: 1.25rem` so cards
   read like notes pinned to a wall. No glass.
4. **Signature moment** — a new guestbook entry **rises gently into place**
   (`.animate-rise`, bounce easing) and a warm "Message posted!" celebration
   confirms the welcome.

### Palette at a glance

- `base-100` **#FBF7F0** warm cream — the page/paper surface.
- `base-content` **#3B2A1E** espresso brown — body + heading ink.
- `primary` **#C2410C** terracotta — **the one precious CTA color** (ration it
  to the single hero action).
- `secondary` **#5E6B47** sage · `accent` **#DA9A3E** honey gold · `neutral`
  **#43342A** warm brown.
- Dark theme (`brand-dark`) lifts these onto a warm near-black espresso base
  (`#1E1712`).

## Caveats

- Brand name/logo/illustrations are placeholders unless supplied.
- Fonts via Google Fonts (Caveat + Quicksand).
- Icons: Lucide (stroke) — flag if a different set is preferred.
- Deliberate design-lint exceptions (cream palette, grain, warm-family
  clustering, handwriting headings) are documented in `consume/prototype.md`.
