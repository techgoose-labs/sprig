# message-composer — motion & jank

Source: `fixtures/eval-app/spec/ui/hearth-prototype.html` @ `data-theme="brand"`
(light). Region: `aside .card` — name input + textarea + char count + "Sign the
guestbook" button. Captured with Playwright (isolate-runner chromium), headless,
1280×950 unless noted.

## What actually moves

The composer has **no entrance and no looping animation of its own** —
`document.getAnimations()` is empty on the card after load, and the only
authored keyframe (`@keyframes brand-rise` / `.animate-rise`) is applied to
_newly-posted wall cards and toasts_, **not** to the composer.

The composer's only motion is the daisyUI button micro-feedback and the
(instant) input focus ring:

| Trigger           | Element                                    | Properties                                           | Duration / easing             | Extracted end-state                                                                                                            |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| hover             | `#postBtn` (`.btn`)                        | `background-color`, `border-color`, `box-shadow`     | 0.2s `cubic-bezier(0,0,.2,1)` | bg darkens ~7% → `oklab(0.5147…)`; box-shadow retained                                                                         |
| `:active` (press) | `#postBtn`                                 | `translate`, `background-color`, `box-shadow`        | 0.2s `cubic-bezier(0,0,.2,1)` | `translate: 0 .5px` (0.5px downward nudge); bg darkens ~5% → `oklab(0.5258…)`; **box-shadow collapses to `0 0 0 0` (removed)** |
| `:focus-visible`  | `#postBtn`                                 | `outline`                                            | (outline not transitioned)    | `outline: 2px solid var(--color-primary)` = `rgb(194,65,12)`, `outline-offset: 2px`                                            |
| focus             | `#msgInput` (`.textarea.textarea-primary`) | — (`transition` resolves to `all 0s` → no animation) | instant                       | `outline: 2px solid var(--color-primary)`, offset 2px; border already primary at rest (textarea-primary)                       |

Press feedback evidence: `screenshots/filmstrip.png` (rest → hover → :active →
:focus-visible). Per-state computed values are in `_capture-data.json`
(`forced.*`).

The button's transition lists `transform` and the active nudge is the CSS
`translate` property (composited) — that part is fine. See the CSS lint below
for the `box-shadow` part.

## Live jank sample — one optimistic post()

Instrumented rAF-delta + LongAnimationFrame + layout-shift observers, then
filled name+message and clicked **Sign the guestbook** (the optimistic write).
Single labeled sample, not a benchmark:

- frames observed: **222**
- dropped frames (>1.5× 16.7ms): **0.5%**
- max frame time: **25.5 ms**
- long-animation-frames > 50ms: **1 entry, 178.9 ms**
- CLS delta: **0** (the optimistic prepend does shift the existing wall cards
  down, but it is input-attributed within 500ms so it is excluded from CLS;
  visually the new card rises via `.animate-rise` transform/opacity)

The single **178.9 ms long-animation-frame** lands on the post click — see the
JS lint below for why.

## Jank findings + rebuild fixes

### JS

1. **[HIGH] Full-wall `innerHTML` rebuild + document-wide icon rescan on every
   post.** `post()` → `renderWall()` does
   `wall.innerHTML = list.map(cardHtml).join("")` (re-renders _all_ existing
   cards, not just the new one) and then `lucide.createIcons()` (rescans every
   `[data-lucide]` in the whole document). Measured as the 178.9 ms
   long-animation-frame above; cost is O(n) in wall length and grows as people
   sign. It also destroys/recreates all existing card DOM (drops
   focus/selection/scroll state, and re-runs would re-trigger sibling animations
   if `isNew` weren't being reset). **Rebuild fix:** insert only the new card —
   build one node and `wall.prepend(node)` — and scope icon creation to that
   subtree (or emit static inline `<svg>`), instead of blowing away and
   re-parsing the whole list. In sprig terms: a keyed list-prepend, not an
   `innerHTML` replace.

2. **[MED] `lucide.createIcons()` is unscoped and called on every render.** Same
   root cause as #1; even outside posting (e.g. demo-state switches) it
   re-parses the entire document's icons. **Rebuild fix:** scope icon creation
   to the changed node, or pre-render the feather icon as static SVG markup so
   no post-render JS icon pass is needed at all.

3. **[LOW] Programmatic smooth scroll stacked onto the post frame.** `post()`
   ends with `$("#wall").scrollIntoView({ behavior: "smooth" })` fired in the
   same tick the wall DOM was fully replaced and the new card began its
   `.animate-rise`, so it piles onto the same busy frame. **Rebuild fix:** with
   the insert-only render (#1) the frame is cheap, so the smooth scroll is fine
   as-is; just don't pair it with a full re-render.

### CSS

4. **[LOW] Post button animates `box-shadow` on hover/active.** `.btn`
   `transition-property` includes `box-shadow`; on hover the shadow is retained
   (repainted as bg-derived color shifts) and on `:active` it transitions to
   `0 0 0 0` (removed). Animating `box-shadow` repaints the shadow region each
   frame. Low severity here: one small button, 0.2s, not persistent. **Rebuild
   fix:** pre-render the rest/hover shadow on a `::before`/`::after`
   pseudo-element and cross-fade its `opacity`; transition only
   `transform`/`translate` + `background-color` on the button itself, not
   `box-shadow`.

### Checked and NOT flagged (so they aren't re-raised downstream)

- `updateCharCount()` runs on every `input` event but does a single
  `textContent` write with **no layout read** — no throttle needed, no thrash.
  Fine.
- **No forced synchronous layout** in composer handlers (no `offsetTop` /
  `getBoundingClientRect`).
- **No `setTimeout`/`setInterval`-driven animation** in the composer itself.
  (The `setTimeout` fade-out in `showToast()` is the **toast** unit's, not the
  composer's.)
- The textarea/input computed `transition: all 0s` is the UA default (duration 0
  ⇒ nothing animates) — **not** a real `transition: all` jank case.
- The card transitions only `outline` (0.2s ease-in-out); `outline` doesn't
  trigger layout or affect siblings. Fine.
- `@keyframes brand-rise` animates `transform` + `opacity` only (compositable) —
  correct approach, and not applied to the composer anyway.

### Behavior note (not jank, for the spec-writer)

- `maxlength="240"` is set on `#msgInput`, so real typed input is hard-clamped
  at 240. The counter is a plain `N/240` string with **no near-limit /
  over-limit color or warning state** — it looks identical at 0/240, 75/240, and
  240/240 (see the three desktop stills). The empty-submit guard shows a
  **warning toast** ("Your note is empty") + refocuses the textarea rather than
  disabling the button (button is never disabled).
