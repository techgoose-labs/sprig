## 1. Classification & behavior

A **page-composition**: it owns no view of its own beyond layout chrome. It
**resolves data** (`resolve.ts`) and **threads it into children**, wires the
composer→wall→toast write loop, and sets the responsive grid. It is not an
island itself — the reactive state lives in `message-wall`.

### Composition (render order — matches the analyst contract)

1. `app-header` (static) — wordmark + tagline + "_N_ have signed" counter (reads
   `signedCount`).
2. `message-composer` (island) — the "Leave a message" card; **writes** a new
   `Message`.
3. `social-proof` (static) — avatar-group + "and others signed today".
4. `message-wall` (island) — "On the wall" heading + count badge + "newest
   first" + the list of `message-card`s (and the empty / loading branches).
   **Holds the reactive `messages` signal**, seeded once from `resolve.ts`.
5. `toast` (island) — fixed `toast-end` stack for transient confirmations.

(2)+(3) sit in the left `aside`; (4) in the right `section`. The prototype's
floating **Demo-states panel** and its **Error-toast button** are throwaway
scaffold — **do not ship them** (they only existed to fake the four
view-states + the error path in a static file).

### Data source & contract

`resolve.ts` returns `{ messages: Message[], signedCount: number }`
(request-response, server-side). The page threads:

- `messages` → `<message-wall [messages]>` → seeds the wall's `messages` signal
  (the one source of truth for both the card list and the count badge — never a
  second count source, per data-model hazard #2).
- `signedCount` → `<app-header [signed-count]>`.
- `loading` → `<message-wall [loading]>` (skeleton branch; client transient, see
  States).

`social-proof` is **honest-static** in the prototype (hard-coded 3 avatars +
"+9"); the real query ("distinct signers in last 24h") is _described, not
extracted — verify during build_ (data-model hazard #4). It does **not** vary by
view-state in any captured screenshot.

### Liveness — request-response, NOT realtime

There is no websocket / poll / SSE / refresh interval anywhere in the source.
The wall is **seeded once** from `resolve.ts` and does not push.
**Honest-staleness note (carry into the wall's spec):** the wall reflects
load-time state **plus the current author's own optimistic additions only** —
other guests' new entries appear **only on refetch/reload**. Do not invent a
realtime feed.

### The write — optimistic flow (the page owns this wiring)

The prototype's `post()` is an in-memory optimistic insert
(`MESSAGES.unshift(entry)` → `renderWall()` → success toast). The rebuild keeps
it optimistic but real:

1. **Snapshot** the wall's `messages` signal.
2. **Mutate local island state** — `message-composer` emits its `post` output
   `{ name, message }`; the page prepends an optimistic `Message`
   (`minutesAgo: 0`, `isNew: true`, `avatar: null`) to the `message-wall`
   `messages` signal **in place** (keyed list-prepend, not a full re-render —
   see Motion / jank).
3. **Fire the POST in the background.**
4. **On success** keep it (reconcile the server `id` / `createdAt` into the
   optimistic row).
5. **On failure roll back** — restore the snapshot (remove the optimistic card)
   **and** surface the error toast _"Couldn't post your message — Something went
   wrong on our end. Give it another try."_ (this copy is the prototype's
   scaffold **Error toast** button text — it is the real failure-path message,
   reused).

**Never** client-toast + `location.reload()`. The wall reconciles in place via
its `messages` signal.

### Client state owned

The page owns **none** — it threads props. The reactive `messages` signal is
owned by `message-wall` (one island, justified: it must mutate the list in place
for optimistic posts + count without a reload). `loading` is a wall-local client
transient. `toast` owns its own queue.

### Data-shape hazards relevant to this page (full list in `data-model.md`)

- **#1 `signedCount` fabricated aggregate / the 47-at-zero lie.** Header =
  `47 + list.length` in the mock. At zero messages the empty screenshot **still
  says "47 have signed"** — a lie. The captured `empty` case reproduces that
  screenshot (`signedCount: 47`), but **build must resolve it to the honest
  `0`** (real source: `count(messages)` ± a server-side historical offset).
  Flagged here and in the `empty` case.
- **#2 count badge desync.** The "On the wall" badge must always equal the
  rendered card count (`messages.length`), incl. the optimistic insert — derive
  from the same signal, never a second source.
- **#5 dual anonymous.** `name` may be `""` (composer blank) or `null` (seed) →
  both collapse to _"Anonymous guest"_ (handled in
  `message-card`/`guest-avatar`).
- **#6 external avatar host.** Seed `avatar` URLs are `i.pravatar.cc`. Cases
  carry the **captured URLs** (to diff the real faces); build should lift
  representative images to `assets/` rather than hot-link. _Described, not
  extracted — verify during build._

## 2. Anatomy

```
<guestbook>                                   ← page root (data-theme="brand" → light, see §A11y/build note)
├─ <app-header [signed-count]="signedCount"/> ← bg-base-200/40, border-b; max-w-5xl, py-7
│     [flame tile] Hearth                                   ⟨users⟩ 53 have signed   (counter: hidden < sm)
│     A community guestbook — pull up a chair.
└─ <main class="mx-auto max-w-5xl px-4 py-8 pb-28">
   └─ grid  gap-8  lg:grid-cols-[360px_minmax(0,1fr)]      ← (fix: minmax(0,1fr), see Responsive bug)
      ├─ <aside class="lg:sticky lg:top-6 self-start space-y-4">
      │   ├─ <message-composer/>     ← "Leave a message" card (name input, textarea, char count, submit)
      │   └─ <social-proof/>         ← avatar-group(-space-x-4) + "and others signed today"
      └─ <section class="min-w-0">   ← (fix: min-w-0 so the long-token track can shrink)
          ├─ header row:  «On the wall» <count badge>            ↑ newest first
          └─ <message-wall>          ← space-y-4 list of <message-card> | empty branch | 4 skeletons
<toast/>                             ← fixed toast-end z-50 (transient; renders nothing at rest)
```

Slots/children: the page composes by **selector**, not projected children —
there is no `<content>` / `_innerHtml`. Each child is its own folder-component
(`app-header`, `message-composer`, `social-proof`, `message-wall`, `toast`; the
wall renders `message-card` which renders `guest-avatar`).

---

## 3. Props table

The page's inputs are exactly what `resolve.ts` threads. Each scalar maps to one
`fixture.json` control; `messages` is an array (no widget) carried per-case as a
bare prop.

| name          | type        | default      | control widget                                        | signal?                                                                |
| ------------- | ----------- | ------------ | ----------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `messages`    | `Message[]` | _(per case)_ | — (array — carried in each `cases/*.json`, no widget) | no — threaded to `message-wall`, which seeds its own `messages` signal |
| `signedCount` | `number`    | `53`         | `number`                                              | no                                                                     |
| `loading`     | `boolean`   | `false`      | `boolean`                                             | **yes** — toggle the skeleton branch live without losing it on remount |

`Message = { id:number, name:string|null, avatar:string|null, message:string, minutesAgo:number }`
(the mock stores `minutesAgo`; the real schema is `createdAt` with `timeAgo`
derived — data-model hazard #3; freeze "now" for deterministic diffs).

---

## 4. States → cases

One case per row. The page's state is the **data state of the wall** (the four
prototype view-states, with the demo panel that drove them dropped). The count
badge value is owned by `message-wall` but listed here because it is visible in
every page screenshot.

| Case       | One-line state                                                             | `messages`                                         | `signedCount` (header)              | wall badge | Diff target                                |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- | ---------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `default`  | Normal — 6 seed cards, newest first                                        | 6 seed (ids 1–6)                                   | `53` (47+6)                         | `6`        | `screenshots/guestbook-desktop-1280.png`   |
| `empty`    | Honest-empty — dashed "The wall is quiet…" card + CTA                      | `[]`                                               | `47` **(the lie — resolve to `0`)** | `0`        | `screenshots/guestbook-state-empty.png`    |
| `loading`  | 4 skeleton cards; badge shows `…`                                          | 6 seed (drives header count only) + `loading:true` | `53`                                | `…`        | `screenshots/guestbook-state-loading.png`  |
| `overflow` | Wrap-torture — 70-char name + run-on + unbreakable token at top of 7 cards | 7 (id 901 torture + 6 seed)                        | `54` (47+7)                         | `7`        | `screenshots/guestbook-state-overflow.png` |

Behavioral notes (verify in the child specs, surfaced here because they are
page-visible):

- **`loading`** is a client transient — in the rebuild data is resolved
  server-side, so this branch is the wall's hydration/refetch skeleton (4 fixed
  skeleton cards, badge `…`). The prototype faked it via boot (`900ms`) and the
  demo panel (`1400ms`).
- **`empty` social-proof** still renders in the captured screenshot (mock is
  static); the honest-empty decision is that real `social-proof` should
  **collapse/hide** at zero recent signers (data-model honest-empty) —
  _described, not extracted — verify during build_. The `empty` case reproduces
  the captured screenshot (social-proof present).
- The optimistic post + warning/error toasts are **events** (§5), not separate
  page cases — they are exercised by tests over the `default`/`empty` cases.

---

## 5. Events

The page emits little directly; it **wires** child events into the optimistic
write loop. These are composition-level integration checks (each a
`capture(page)` predicate + a DOM follow-up). Per-child micro-events (button
hover, `input` char-count, textarea focus) live in the child specs, not here.
Tests land under the case noted.

**E1 — Optimistic post prepends a card + fires success toast** (`default` case):

```ts
const ev = await capture(page); // install BEFORE goto
await page.goto("/pages/guestbook/default");
await waitHydrated(page);
await page.locator("message-composer textarea").fill("Hello from the test");
await page.locator("message-composer button").click(); // "Sign the guestbook"
await ev.expect((e) => e.type === "click" && /button/.test(e.source), {
  timeout: 3000,
});
// composition result — wall prepends the optimistic card, toast confirms:
await expect(page.locator("message-wall article").first()).toContainText(
  "Hello from the test",
);
await expect(page.locator("[role='alert']")).toContainText("Message posted!");
// (the composer's own `post` output event — e.source === "message-composer", e.type === "post",
//  e.detail.message === "Hello from the test" — is asserted in the message-composer spec.)
```

**E2 — Empty-state CTA focuses the composer** (`empty` case):

```ts
const ev = await capture(page);
await page.goto("/pages/guestbook/empty");
await waitHydrated(page);
await page.getByRole("button", { name: /be the first to sign/i }).click();
await ev.expect((e) => e.type === "click" && /button/.test(e.source));
await expect(page.locator("message-composer textarea")).toBeFocused(); // focusComposer()
```

**E3 — Empty submit shows a warning toast and adds no card** (`default` case):

```ts
const ev = await capture(page);
await page.goto("/pages/guestbook/default");
await waitHydrated(page);
const before = await page.locator("message-wall article").count();
await page.locator("message-composer button").click(); // textarea empty
await expect(page.locator("[role='alert']")).toContainText(
  "Your note is empty",
);
expect(await page.locator("message-wall article").count()).toBe(before); // no insert
```

(Failure-path rollback — E1 with a forced server error → optimistic card
removed + error toast _"Couldn't post your message"_ — is owned by the
wall/composer write loop; _described here, lifted to the wall spec's tests
during build_.)

---

## 6. Motion

The page has **no entrance/loop of its own**; all motion is delegated to
children. Tokens are verbatim from `design-tokens.md` / `css/page.css`.

- **New-card entrance** —
  `@keyframes brand-rise { from { opacity:0; transform:translateY(8px) } to
  { opacity:1; transform:none } }`,
  `.animate-rise { animation: brand-rise var(--dur-base)=320ms
  var(--ease-bounce)=cubic-bezier(0.34,1.56,0.64,1) both }`.
  Applied **once** to an optimistically posted card (`isNew`, then cleared).
  Compositor-only (opacity+transform) — **clean**, no rebuild needed. Filmstrip:
  `components/message-card/screenshots/filmstrip.png`.
- **Toast** — `animate-rise` on entrance; exit is an inline JS transition
  `opacity .25s, transform .25s` → `translateY(8px)` then removed at `260ms`.
  Owned by `toast`.
- **Button micro-feedback** (composer submit) — `0.2s cubic-bezier(0,0,.2,1)`
  bg/shadow + `:active` `translate 0 .5px`. Filmstrip:
  `components/message-composer/screenshots/filmstrip.png`.
- **`prefers-reduced-motion: reduce`** — global blanket
  `*{ animation-duration:.01ms!important; transition-duration:.01ms!important }`.
  Preserve. Note the toast's **inline** JS-set exit transition is not reliably
  caught by `!important` — gate it on a reduced-motion check (toast spec).

**Page-level jank finding to fix (the write path):** the prototype's `post()` →
`renderWall()` does `wall.innerHTML = list.map(cardHtml).join("")` + a
document-wide `lucide.createIcons()` rescan — a **178–195 ms
long-animation-frame per post**, O(n) in wall size. **Rebuild fix (this is
exactly the optimistic flow in §1):** prepend only the **one** new keyed card to
the wall's `messages` signal and let the framework patch that node; inline the
clock/feather icons as static SVG so there is no post-render icon rescan. Then
the 320 ms entrance runs alone. The trailing smooth `scrollIntoView` is fine
once the frame is cheap.

_No page-level filmstrip was captured (page motion is delegated) — the two child
filmstrips above are the references. Described, not extracted — verify the
composed entrance during build._

---

## 7. Responsive

The source file declares **no width `@media` of its own**; behavior comes
entirely from Tailwind default breakpoints (measured). Only `sm` and `lg` are
used; `md`/`xl`/`2xl` unused.

| Width                  | Layout                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `< 640px` (mobile-390) | Single column, mobile-first. Header counter "_N_ have signed" **hidden** (`hidden sm:flex`). Composer + social-proof stack **above** the wall. Cards full-width, body text wraps to 3–4 lines. Container `max-w-5xl px-4`. Diff: `guestbook-mobile-390.png`. |
| `≥ 640px` (`sm`)       | Header counter **appears** (the only `sm` change). Still single column until `lg`. Diff: `guestbook-tablet-768.png` (768 shows counter + single column).                                                                                                     |
| `≥ 1024px` (`lg`)      | Main becomes **two columns** `lg:grid-cols-[360px_1fr]` (composer 360px fixed, wall fluid) and the composer becomes **`lg:sticky lg:top-6`** (`self-start`) so it stays pinned while the wall scrolls. Diff: `guestbook-desktop-1280.png`.                   |

### LAYOUT BUG to fix (captured at the page level — record + correct in build)

The **overflow** state blows out page width: measured `scrollWidth 1396` at a
`1280` viewport (+116px horizontal overflow) and **+486px** at `390`. Root
cause: the message body uses `break-words [overflow-wrap:anywhere]` but
**`break-words` (`overflow-wrap:break-word`) wins** and does **not** reduce the
element's _min-content_ width, so the unbreakable token
(`Supercalifragilistic…xxxx`) forces the grid's `1fr` track (=
`minmax(auto,1fr)`, min = `auto` = min-content) wider than the viewport.

**Fix (all three, belt-and-suspenders):**

1. `lg:grid-cols-[360px_minmax(0,1fr)]` — let the wall track shrink below its
   content min.
2. `min-w-0` on the wall `section` (the grid item) — override `min-width:auto`.
3. Use `[overflow-wrap:anywhere]` **alone** on the message `<p>` (drop the
   redundant `break-words`, which loses to it and confuses min-content), so long
   tokens break to fit.

This is exposed by the `overflow` isolate case at the `1024`+ and `360` viewport
presets — diff against `guestbook-state-overflow.png` and assert the document
does **not** scroll horizontally (`scrollWidth <= clientWidth`).

---

## 8. A11y

- **Landmarks:** `<header>` (banner), `<main>`, `<aside>` (complementary —
  composer), `<section>` (the wall). Keep them as real elements.
- **Heading order:** `h1` "Hearth" (wordmark, font-display) → `h2` "Leave a
  message" (composer) → `h2` "On the wall" (wall) → `h3` "The wall is quiet… for
  now" (empty branch). One `h1`; no skips.
- **Counter:** `<app-header>` "_N_ have signed" is hidden below `sm`
  (`hidden sm:flex`) — purely decorative duplicate of the wall badge, so hiding
  it is fine; do not make it the only count source.
- **Composer:** name input + textarea have visible `<legend>`/labels; helper
  text ("Shown next to your message…", "Keep it kind."); char counter `0/240`
  (`tabular-nums`). Submit is **never disabled** — empty submit raises a warning
  toast and refocuses the textarea (focus management on validation).
- **Focus order:** name → message → submit → (wall CTA when empty). The empty
  CTA's `focusComposer()` moves focus to the textarea — preserve as managed
  focus.
- **Toasts:** `role="alert"` (assertive). Ensure an `aria-live` region so screen
  readers announce post-success / validation / error.
- **Reduced motion:** honored globally (§6); verify the toast inline-transition
  gate.
- **Theme/contrast:** screenshots are `data-theme="brand"` (light) — see build
  note in §10.

---

## 9. Used on

This **is** a page (`pages/guestbook/`) — Hearth's single route (`/`). It is
page-local, not shared. Components it composes: `app-header`, `message-composer`
(island), `social-proof`, `message-wall` (island) → `message-card` →
`guest-avatar`, `toast` (island). `message-card`/`guest-avatar` are
shared-capable (the wall, social-proof and composer-preview all render
avatars/cards) — confirm shared-vs-local placement from each child's own spec.

---

## 10. Isolate build plan

**Lands at:** `src/pages/guestbook/` — selector `guestbook` (folder basename).
Page-composition → template threads `resolve.ts` data into the child selectors;
no `logic.ts` required on the page itself (state lives in `message-wall`).

**Preview routes** (from `fixture.json`: `category:"guestbook"`, no `folder` →
`/pages/<category>/<case>`):

- `/pages/guestbook/default` — normal, 6 seed cards → diff
  `screenshots/guestbook-desktop-1280.png`
- `/pages/guestbook/empty` — honest-empty branch → diff
  `screenshots/guestbook-state-empty.png`
- `/pages/guestbook/loading` — 4 skeletons, badge `…` → diff
  `screenshots/guestbook-state-loading.png`
- `/pages/guestbook/overflow` — wrap torture → diff
  `screenshots/guestbook-state-overflow.png` (also check `360`/`1024` viewport
  presets for the no-horizontal-scroll assertion, §7 bug)

**Cases → screenshots** (the one-line state each demonstrates): see §4 table.

**Events → tests:** E1 → `cases/default/tests/post-optimistic.spec.ts`; E3 →
`cases/default/tests/empty-submit-warning.spec.ts`; E2 →
`cases/empty/tests/empty-cta-focus.spec.ts`. The `overflow` case gets a
no-horizontal-scroll assertion test
(`cases/overflow/tests/no-overflow.spec.ts`). (Build session lifts the §5
predicates verbatim.)

**Loop:** scaffold the page + its 5 children → build each **child** in isolation
first (their own `isolate/`), diffing against their stills → **then** compose
`guestbook`: drop this `isolate/`, run `sprig isolate`, open each
`/pages/guestbook/<case>`, diff vs the page screenshot. During early composition
any not-yet-ready child may be `_mocks: { "<selector>": "stub" }`'d; **unstub
before the final diff**. Apply the §7 grid fix and re-check `overflow` at
`1024`/`360`. Lift E1–E3 into the case `tests/`, run, iterate. Compose-last —
the page is the last unit to go green.

**Build-verify gaps (described, not extracted):**

- **Theme:** screenshots are `data-theme="brand"` (light) but the token default
  is `brand-dark` (design-tokens). There is no fixture field for theme — the
  page root (or shell) must render under `[data-theme="brand"]` for the diff to
  match. _Verify during build._ (`background` is set to the light base-100
  `#FBF7F0` so the stage chrome matches.)
- **`signedCount` honest source** — the `empty` case carries `47` (the captured
  lie); build must wire the real `0`-at-zero source (hazard #1).
- **`social-proof` empty-collapse** + its real "signed today" query (hazard #4).
- **Avatar host** — cases carry captured `i.pravatar.cc` URLs; lift to `assets/`
  (hazard #6).
- **Composer `post` output event** exact name/detail shape (lifted from the
  composer spec).
