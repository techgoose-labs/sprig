## Entities

The whole "backend" is **one flat entity**. There are no relations, no nesting,
no joins.

### `Message` (a guestbook entry)

| Field       | Type                | Value-set / constraints                                                                      | Notes                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| ----------- | ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `id`        | integer             | PK, unique                                                                                   | Seed ids `1–6`; overflow torture id `901`; runtime new posts start at `1000` and increment (`nextId++`). Also used as the avatar-tint selector: `id % 3`.                                                                                                                                                |
| `name`      | string \| null      | free text; **empty string AND `null` both mean anonymous**                                   | Renders as `"Anonymous guest"` when blank/`null` after `.trim()`. `initials()` derives a 1–2 letter monogram from it. **Hazard:** two distinct "no name" representations — normalize.                                                                                                                    |
| `avatar`    | string(URL) \| null | external image URL or `null`                                                                 | `null` → tinted-initials placeholder. Seed uses `https://i.pravatar.cc/96?img=N` (N ∈ {47,15,8} for photo entries). **Hazard:** external host dependency — the rebuild should not bake pravatar into the schema; treat avatar as an optional image ref and lift sample images to `assets/` for fixtures. |
| `message`   | string              | **max 240 chars** (client `maxlength="240"` + char counter), required (non-empty after trim) | Free text incl. unicode/emoji (seed has `🌍`) and unbreakable tokens (overflow set). Must be HTML-escaped on render (`escapeHtml`).                                                                                                                                                                      |
| `createdAt` | timestamp           | —                                                                                            | **NOT in the mock.** The mock stores `minutesAgo` (integer) instead — a prototype shortcut. See hazard below. The real schema field is a creation timestamp; relative time is computed at render.                                                                                                        |

Transient (UI-only, **not** schema):

| Field   | Type    | Notes                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| ------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `isNew` | boolean | Set on optimistically-posted entries to trigger the `animate-rise` entrance once, then cleared (`m.isNew = false`) after first render. Never persisted; lives only in client signal state. |

### Value-sets / enums

- **View state** (UI, not data):
  `viewState ∈ {"normal", "empty", "loading", "overflow"}` — these are **render
  states of the wall**, not entity values. They become `message-wall`
  states→cases. Driven only by throwaway scaffold (the demo panel) + the initial
  fake-load.
- **Toast kind**: `{"success", "error", "warning", "info"}` — UI notification
  tone, not stored data.
- **Avatar tint** (for placeholder avatars): rotates `id % 3` over
  `[neutral, secondary, accent]` (`AVATAR_TINTS`). Deterministic from `id`.

## Cardinality at load

| Set                      | Count at load | Composition                                                                                 |
| ------------------------ | ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `SEED_MESSAGES` (normal) | **6**         | ids 1–6; mix of 3 photo + 3 placeholder avatars; `minutesAgo` 8 → 1500                      |
| `OVERFLOW_MESSAGES`      | **7**         | 1 torture entry (id 901: 70+ char name, run-on + unbreakable token) prepended to the 6 seed |
| empty                    | **0**         | honest-empty state rendered                                                                 |
| loading                  | n/a           | 4 skeleton cards (fixed count) shown for ~900ms boot / ~1400ms demo                         |

Ordering: **newest first** (the header says "newest first ↑"). The seed array is
already in newest-first order (ascending `minutesAgo`); optimistic posts
`unshift` to the front (`minutesAgo: 0`). Real schema:
`ORDER BY createdAt DESC`.

## Generation

- **Seeded & fully deterministic.** All content is the hardcoded `SEED_MESSAGES`
  literal — no RNG, no `Date.now()`. `timeAgo(minutesAgo)` and `initials(name)`
  and `id % 3` tints are pure functions → identical render every load. Good for
  fixtures: case JSON can carry exact values.
- **The one non-determinism in a faithful rebuild:** relative time. The mock
  dodges it by storing `minutesAgo` literals. A real app stores `createdAt` and
  computes `timeAgo(now − createdAt)`, which drifts with wall-clock. **For
  deterministic fixtures/screenshots, freeze "now"** (or keep storing a fixed
  offset in fixtures) so `timeAgo` output is stable across captures.
- `timeAgo` buckets (reproduce exactly): `<1 → "just now"`;
  `<60 → "{n} min ago"`; `<24h → "{h} hour(s) ago"`; `==1 day → "yesterday"`;
  else `"{d} day(s) ago"`.

## Component → entity reverse index

| Component          | Reads / writes                       | Fields touched                                                 |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `message-card`     | reads 1 `Message`                    | `name`, `avatar`, `message`, `minutesAgo`(→createdAt), `isNew` |
| `guest-avatar`     | reads `Message` subset               | `name` (→ initials), `avatar`, `id` (→ tint)                   |
| `message-wall`     | reads `Message[]` + count            | the list; `length` → `#wallCount` badge                        |
| `message-composer` | **writes** a new `Message`           | creates `{name, message}`; server assigns `id`,`createdAt`     |
| `social-proof`     | reads `Message[]` subset + aggregate | recent signers' avatars + "and N others" count                 |
| `app-header`       | reads aggregate count                | `signedCount` = derived total (see hazards)                    |

## Data-shape hazards (flag for the builder — these are correctness traps, not perf)

1. **`signedCount` is a fabricated global aggregate.** Header shows
   `base(47) + (empty ? 0 : list.length)`. The `47` is a hard-coded fiction.
   **Decide a real source**: `count(messages)` (+ optional historical offset
   stored server-side), or a dedicated counter. In honest-empty it currently
   shows `47` — but with zero messages "47 have signed" is a lie; the honest
   value is `0`. Resolve before build.
2. **`wallCount` badge is a layout-rendered count.** It must always equal the
   number of cards actually rendered (`list.length`), including the optimistic
   insert. Derive it from the **same** `messages` signal the wall renders —
   never a second source of truth, or it desyncs after a post.
3. **`minutesAgo` vs `createdAt`.** Stored relative time is a prototype
   shortcut. The schema field is a timestamp; relative display is derived. Don't
   persist `minutesAgo`.
4. **`social-proof` "+9 and others signed today"** is an aggregate over a
   "signed today" subset minus the shown avatars. Both the subset selection
   (which 3 avatars) and the "+N" count are fabricated in the mock (static
   markup). Decide the real query (e.g. distinct signers in last 24h) and the
   empty behavior (see honest-empty).
5. **Dual "anonymous" representation.** `name` can be `null` (seed) or `""`
   (composer leaves blank). Both must collapse to `"Anonymous guest"`. Normalize
   at the boundary.
6. **External avatar host.** `i.pravatar.cc` is a third-party dependency baked
   into seed rows. The schema should treat `avatar` as an opaque optional URL;
   fixtures should lift representative images into `assets/` rather than
   hot-link.
7. **Overflow torture data is a wrap-robustness case, not a perf case.** id
   901's 70-char hyphenated name + 350-char run-on + unbreakable
   `Supercalifragilistic…xxxx` token exist to prove the card wraps
   (`break-words [overflow-wrap:anywhere]`) without blowing out the
   `360px / 1fr` grid. Keep it as a `message-card` / `message-wall` `overflow`
   case. **Do not** spec virtualization / pagination / perf — the data set is
   tiny (≤7).

## Honest-empty

The mock **always has data** (6 seed entries; the boot even fakes a 900ms load
then settles to normal). The empty state is only reachable via the throwaway
demo panel. **Build must render the honest-empty branch when `resolve.ts`
returns zero messages**, not treat "has data" as guaranteed:

- **`message-wall` empty** — the real honest-empty: a dashed-border card,
  feather icon, _"The wall is quiet… for now"_, _"No one has signed yet. Be the
  first…"_, and a primary CTA _"Be the first to sign"_ that focuses the
  composer. Ship this branch; it is the zero-row truth.
- **`app-header` signedCount** at zero — see hazard #1 (should read `0`, not
  `47`).
- **`social-proof`** with zero recent signers — should collapse/hide, not render
  "+0 and others".
- **`message-card`** has no empty (it's always given one message), but its
  _fields_ can be empty: blank `name` (→ "Anonymous guest") and `null` `avatar`
  (→ initials) are its honest field-empty cases and must be covered.

## Liveness (request-response, NOT realtime)

There is **no** websocket, polling, SSE, or `setInterval` refresh in the mock.
New messages from _other_ guests appear only on reload. The composer's
optimistic insert is the **only** live update, and it is the local author's own
write. So:

- `message-wall` is **request-response**, seeded once from `resolve.ts`; it does
  **not** push. Honest-staleness note for its spec: the wall reflects load-time
  state plus the current author's optimistic additions — it will not show
  others' new entries until refetch/reload. Do not invent a realtime feed.
- The only timers in the source are cosmetic: boot fake-load `900ms`, demo
  loading `1400ms`, toast auto-dismiss `3200ms` + `260ms` fade — none are data
  liveness.
