// Your app's persisted state. Add serializable fields and inject(State) anywhere
// (pages, islands). The framework serializes it to localStorage on every navigation
// and on reload, and restores it on load — so state survives both. state.reset()
// restores these defaults AND clears the saved copy in localStorage.
