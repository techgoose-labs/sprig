# fixes.md — audit of bullshit-app

Hunt → root-cause complete. Fix queue below (severity-ordered). A box turns ☑
only when FIX applied the change **and** VALIDATE's check passed. Evidence in

**B3 framework fix (verified):** `framework/.sprig/compiler/hydrate.ts`
`morphChildren` — (1) at the island-host level, exclude the host's own
`<script class="sprig-props">` bridge + whitespace separator from the
position-keyed alignment (`isPropsBridge`/`isBlankText`, `hostLevel`); (2) a
KEYED island-host pre-pass that matches each live `<sprig-island data-sel=X>` to
the re-render's counterpart by `data-sel` (not position) and pins it untouched —
so no structural skew can replaceChild a hydrated nested island away. Regression
test: `framework/.sprig/compiler/zz-nested-island-propsbridge.test.ts` (2 cases,
red→green). Full compiler suite 141/141 green. Live: counter `0→3`, like `0→2`
on `/ui` after hydration; both `<sprig-island>` hosts survive (no bare
`<counter>`).

### ☑ [HIGH · bug] B1 — Missing widget `/ui/widget/:id` returns HTTP 200 (soft 404)

**What's wrong** — A missing widget renders the "Widget not found" view but the
response stays HTTP 200, so a missing page reads as real to crawlers and the
browser. Violates user-story #3 (a missing widget must be **404**). **Evidence**
— `curl -i /ui/widget/nope` → `HTTP/1.1 200 OK`; in-page fetch → 200;
`fixes-evidence/widget-nope-soft404.png`; `fixes-evidence/evidence.json`
(`soft_404_proof`). Controls: `/ui/widget/a` → 200 (Sprocket), `/ui/bogus` → 404
by design. **Root cause** — `src/pages/widget/resolve.ts:20` — on a miss the
resolver returns `{ id, widget, notFound: true }` but never calls
`setResponseStatus`, so `bootstrap.fetch` applies `root.status ?? 200`
(`framework/.sprig/core.ts:550`) → default 200. **Fix** — import
`{ setResponseStatus, currentInjector }` from `@mrg-keystone/sprig`; on the
miss, `setResponseStatus(currentInjector(), 404)` before returning. The resolver
is synchronous, so `currentInjector()` is still the active route injector (no
construction-time capture needed). (build → `references/component-model.md`,
data-and-di.) **Verify fixed** —
`curl -i http://localhost:8099/ui/widget/nope | head -1` → `HTTP/1.1 404`;
`/ui/widget/a` still `200`. **Fixed** — `src/pages/widget/resolve.ts`: import
now `{ currentInjector, setResponseStatus, type Resolve }` from
`@mrg-keystone/sprig`; on the miss (`widget === null`) call
`setResponseStatus(currentInjector(), 404)` before returning (resolver is
synchronous, so `currentInjector()` is the active route injector →
`injector.root.status = 404` → `core.ts:550` emits 404). `deno check` clean. The
running dev server bundles resolvers at startup so the live curl still showed
200 — **Needs server restart** to observe (validator restarts on a fresh
server).

### ☑ [HIGH · bug] B2 — Like control does nothing on click (dead island, no logic.ts)

**What's wrong** — On `/ui` the ♥ Like button renders but clicking does nothing
— the count stays "0 likes". It reads as interactive but has no behavior.
Violates user-story #5. **Evidence** — before/after click1/click2 all "0 likes";
no `isl.like-button.js` in the network; SSR renders a plain
`<button class="like-btn">♥ Like</button>` with no `<sprig-island>` wrapper and
`(click)` stripped. `fixes-evidence/evidence.json` (`like_button_dead_island`).
**Root cause** — `src/components/like-button/template.html:6` wires
`(click)="like()"`, but the folder contains **only** `template.html` — no
`logic.ts`. In sprig's model that makes it a **static** component: zero JS, the
`(click)` is stripped at SSR and never hydrates. (Contrast:
`src/islands/counter/logic.ts` exists, so `<counter>` is live.) Genuine catalog
F3 — not the false-positive (which is "no `(event)` bindings"). **Fix** — add
`src/components/like-button/logic.ts` (default class) owning `like()` + a
`signal` count, e.g.
`count = signal(0); like(){ this.count.set(this.count()+1) }`, and read
`{{ count() }} likes` in the template. The `logic.ts` makes the folder an island
so the `(click)` hydrates — mirror `src/islands/counter/logic.ts`. (build →
`references/component-model.md`, islands.) **Verify fixed** — Playwright on
`/ui`: wait hydrated, click `.like-btn`, assert `.like-count` changes from "0
likes"; the `like-button` island chunk loads; console clean. **Fixed** — added
`src/components/like-button/logic.ts` (default class `LikeButton` with
`count = signal(0)` + `like(){ this.count.set(this.count()+1) }`, mirroring
`src/islands/counter/logic.ts`); updated
`src/components/like-button/template.html:2` so the count reads
`{{ count() }} likes`. The new `logic.ts` makes the folder an island so the
`(click)="like()"` now hydrates. `deno check` clean. Structural change (new
island file) → **Needs server restart** for the `sprig dev` rebuild to emit the
island chunk.

### ☐ [LOW · bug] B4 — `/favicon.ico` 404 on every page (deferred — cosmetic)

**What's wrong** — Browser auto-request for `/favicon.ico` 404s, logging a
console error on every page. Cosmetic only. **Evidence** — console:
`Failed to load resource: 404 @ http://localhost:8099/favicon.ico`. **Root
cause** — no favicon under the app's static assets dir. **Fix** — add a
`favicon.ico` to the app's static assets, or a route returning 204. **Verify
fixed** — `curl -o /dev/null -w '%{http_code}' /favicon.ico` → 200/204.
**Deferred** — low/cosmetic; not in the active fix queue.

## Framework defects (out of app scope — do NOT fix in this app audit)

### B3 — Counter island's content wiped by client hydration (FRAMEWORK)

**What's wrong** — SSR sends a full counter
(`<button>+1</button><span>0</span>`); after the home page hydrates, the counter
subtree is gone (empty `<sprig-island>` shell, or a bare `<counter>`), so it
can't increment. Violates user-story #4. The counter's own `logic.ts` is the
correct signal pattern — this is **not** an app bug. **Root cause** —
`framework/.sprig/compiler/hydrate.ts:686` `morphChildren` aligns old vs new
children by **index**. The home page is a root island (it has a `logic.ts`); on
its re-render `patchInnerHtml` emits body-only HTML that omits the host's own
leading `<script class="sprig-props">` bridge → a one-node index skew → the live
`<main>` (holding the hydrated `<counter>` host) aligns against `undefined` and
is removed (`:693`) / replaced with a clone (`:707`). The
`correspondsToIslandHost` guard (`:703`) never protects it because `<main>` is
cloned wholesale, never recursed into. Reproduced empirically against the real
`hydrate.ts`. Secondary: `island-infer.ts classify()` is dead code (no non-test
importer) so any `logic.ts` folder — even an `onServerInit`-only page — is
treated as an island; and the existing `zz-nested-island-preserve/-morph` tests
omit the props-script-as-first-child, which is the gap that let this regress.
**Fix (framework, deferred)** — exclude the island host's own
`<script class="sprig-props">` (and adjacent whitespace) from `morphChildren`'s
position-keyed alignment (pin/skip it like `correspondsToIslandHost` does for a
live child host), so the re-rendered body aligns position-for-position and
nested islands are preserved. Add a regression test whose parent host's first
child IS the props `<script>`. **Risk: medium — touches the core client morph
algorithm; do as a focused change with the full hydration suite green.** Out of
scope for an app audit; recorded here for the framework owner.

## Checked and healthy

- `/ui` → 200, greeting "Hello, sprig 👋 — Widget Store" (story #1).
- `/ui/widget/a` → 200 "Sprocket"; `/ui/widget/b` → 200 "Flange" (story #2).
- Off-base paths 404 by design: `/` and `/ui/bogus` (base = `/ui`).
- `src/islands/counter/logic.ts` is the correct signal-based island pattern —
  the wipe (B3) is a framework hydration defect, not a code-pattern problem.
- Performance clean: TTFB 2ms, DCL/load 26ms, CLS 0, no longtasks/LoAF.
